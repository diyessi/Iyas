1762 NYT20000829.0076-22 25 13.20974160829099 false Some 60 years ago, David O. Selznick experienced a similar frustration. Despite combing the United States for more than a year, he could not find the perfect actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in ``Gone With The Wind.''

1762 NYT19990324.0279-9 30 12.599454205213787 false So this is a crazily unpredictable moment for everybody involved with Scarlett O'Hara, except Conroy, and the stakes are high. The first sequel to Mitchell's epic, ``Scarlett'' (Warner Books, 1991) by Alexandra Ripley, was a huge commercial success. When St. Martin's acquired the rights for a second sequel from Mitchell's literary estate, the house planned to have Emma Tennant, its author of two Jane Austen sequels, write the sequel to Ms. Ripley's book.
1762 NYT19981013.0266-7 31 12.457178015015137 false So why its comparable obscurity? The answer may lie not only in its title but in its timing. ``The Custom of the Country'' arrived in 1913, nine years after ``The House of Mirth'' and seven years before ``The Age of Innocence.'' Bad-girl protagonists were not yet in literary fashion; but the mercurial Undine Spragg anticipates Scarlett O'Hara by almost a quarter-century.

A jeweler made Belle earrings _ named for Belle Watling (the madam of the local brothel) _ in the shape of little bells and sold those. Scarlett hair bows sold for five cents at the dime stores and there were beautiful paper doll books.''
1762 NYT20000217.0059-2 36 12.042653595403973 false The lobby staircase is of the sort that Scarlett O'Hara might have favored. But fiddle-dee-dee, that's not all. More than a million dollars' worth of renovations have added freshness to the large, comfortable rooms. In my room, an armoire (housing a TV) and multipaned windows gave the feeling of being in a friend's guest room rather than an inn with 126 rooms.
1762 NYT19981104.0430-2 37 11.917291056399115 true The bargaining has been as theatrical as life at Tara, largely because of Conroy's outrageously bold contemplation that he might kill off Scarlett O'Hara. When the trustees finally focused on that, the idea held such terror it was as if they had run smack into General Sherman on the sidewalk in Atlanta.

1762 NYT19980626.0133-7 39 11.76553849706044 false The plot is, as ever, based on Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel about Scarlett O'Hara, the scrappy young daughter of an Irish plantation owner (Thomas Mitchell) in pre-bellum Georgia. The film opens on Scarlett's bickering with Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), her flirtations with beaus and her undignified pleas to Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), a weak-spirited, whippet-thin dreamer who's about to marry his cousin Melanie (Olivia De Havilland, saintly as ever) but lusts after Scarlett nevertheless.
1762 NYT19990323.0006-7 40 11.691751195867589 false Fittingly, he first won attention with a weekly humor column he wrote for The Macon News after The Democrat closed. His review of ``Gone With the Wind,'' which was reprinted in more than 40 newspapers, said that Scarlett O'Hara ``was as changeable as a baby's underwear.'' The movie was so long and the seats in the theater so hard, he added, that by the time Rhett Butler tells Scarlett, ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,'' neither did the audience.
1762 APW19980627.0922-11 41 11.688567498256758 false The publicity-wise producer realized he needed a gimmick to keep the book in the public eye during the two or three years before the film could be made and released. The Search for Scarlett O'Hara was launched, with talent scouts auditioning thousands of young women throughout the country.

It's squeakily spry and not as dramatic or Deep South as, say, that of Scarlett O'Hara, but it evokes her spirit. More proof that, even though Jordan is a longtime Los Angeles resident, you can't take the South out of the Southerner.

1762 NYT20000703.0266-9 44 11.468458200463909 false This Scarlett O'Hara management philosophy of thinking about it tomorrow is the best she can muster. Her decision to close was prompted by the unexpected death of her sister-in-law, Genelle Rosanky, who had been with her since she first opened the store. Rosanky handled all the bookkeeping duties.
1762 NYT19981216.0263-17 45 11.468458200463909 false Deciduous hollies have three different bloom times, so hybridizers have developed certain male pollinators that bloom at the same time as the female plants. Southern Gentleman, for instance, is supposed to pollinate Winter Red, and Rhett Butler was designed for _ let me guess _ Scarlett O'Hara.
1762 NYT19991123.0262-2 46 11.256485508241031 false The trick is to disappear into a character so audiences forget they are watching a popular singer. Sinatra pulled this off some of the time; Madonna has yet to. In ``Ride With the Devil,'' Jewel is surprisingly effective at turning herself into a Civil War widow, who is part Scarlett O'Hara, part Melanie.

1762 NYT19981029.0135-17 49 10.85520959776363 false Somebody must have forgiven this failing, however, because hybridizers are now turning out popular improved garden varieties that have larger berries and more of them. Some hybrids are crosses with the Japanese winterberry, Ilex serrata, such as the new Scarlett O'Hara. (Its male pollinator is, of course, Rhett Butler.) Winter Red and Harvest Red are two other good ones.

The singer indeed cherishes it and won't settle for second-best, baby. But then there's the Catholic-run Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in Lincoln, Neb., which owns madonna.org and wants the dot-com, too. Finally, there's Dan Parisi, a New Jersey entrepreneur who owns the domain and previously used it for pornographic material. He claims the Material Girl has no more right to it than anyone else with the same name. And: He offered the name to the hospital last spring. A decision on ultimate ownership is due from the United Nation's World Intellectual Property Organization soon.

A case brought by the entertainer Madonna against a California pornographer who until last year published a site at www.madonna.com is pending. Madonna, who has her own site at Madonnafanclub.com, is widely expected to win. But the singer Sting, whose real name is Gordon Sumner, lost his battle for the address www.sting.com after arbitrators ruled that the word sting is generic and that Sumner had not trademarked it.

But in her book ``Cookwise,'' Shirley Corriher, a food scientist, writes that the most accurate way to determine the color of eggs a hen will lay is to examine her ears.

One thing you definitely want to avoid discussing is that iguanas carry salmonella bacteria on their skin and are sometimes infested with ticks. Iguanas do not respond well to having their personal hygiene called into question, so you probably ought to talk about something more innocuous, like the weather, unless you want to end up like that unfortunate housewife in ``Terminator 2.''

Dr. Censky said they were able to verify 15 animals, but suspected there were more. Identifying the lizards, known as green iguanas, as outsiders was simple, researchers said. They have a blue-green coloration and dark rings around their tails, making them easily distinguishable from the other iguana species on the island, which is brown and has a plain tail.

In 1990, the Mississippi Legislature cleared the way for the counties along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast to offer dockside gambling. The idea was to keep things small, with a historic riverboat feel, so as not to insult the conservative Christian sensibilities of many residents. Early on, one gaming official took pains to point out in the Mississippi Business Journal that the combined square footage of the dozens of casino boats then docked in Mississippi was only as large as two Las Vegas casinos.

Peter Wendover, a House member from New York, proposed a flag with 13 stripes, with a star for each state. Congress accepted the idea, and April 4, 1818, it set the number of stripes at 13 again.
