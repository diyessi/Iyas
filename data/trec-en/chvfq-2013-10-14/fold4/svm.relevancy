Despite clumsy nods to Houdini's complex ego, his wife's complex alcoholism and the magician's complex relationship with magic, ``Houdini'' is satisfied with a paint-by-number portrait that, basically, tells us Houdini had his faults.

When you cast a vote for president, you are technically voting for a set of presidential electors. If your candidate wins the popular vote in your state, the electors you have voted for then cast their votes in the Electoral College. There are 538 electoral votes, meaning it takes 270 to win.

2078 NYT20000107.0114-26 7 10.346987045902953 false The most popular brand, DuPont's Corian, costs between $110 and $175 per linear foot. The price depends on the color, whether it has to be fitted to a sink and general configuration of the counter top. Granite costs approximately 15 to 20 percent more than Corian.
2078 NYT20000107.0114-29 8 10.172046325835556 false There are several Corian look-alike products on the market, including the Wilsonart product and Nevamar's Fountainhead.
2078 NYT20000107.0114-28 9 9.809147996513406 true A new pure acrylic material that costs about 20 percent less than Corian is Wilsonart's SSV, a one-eighth-inch solid surface veneer (Corian is 1 1/2-inches thick) that is applied to particle board. This comes in the same patterns as acrylic resins and granite.
2078 NYT20000323.0082-19 10 9.809147996513406 false I have two Corian vanities with self-contained sinks in my bathrooms and my wife and I like them. My wife priced Corian for her kitchen redo and reversed her field immediately upon hearing the cost. She opted for tile. We both are happy with it. The grout joints are very, very thin, reducing but not eliminating the plague of dirty, uncleanable grout.
2078 NYT20000126.0101-44 11 9.65178322291828 false Cost is $120 per linear foot, installed, compared with $60 to $100 per linear foot, installed, for Corian.
2078 NYT20000323.0082-14 12 9.411111200867655 false Q. I am remodeling my kitchen, and am wondering which way to go with the counter tops: Corian vs. granite. And could the draining board be granite?
2078 NYT20000323.0082-17 13 9.372882331773676 false As for Corian vs. granite, it's a tossup. Prices are similar, although some householders have told me they found granite to be less expensive. Corian is virtually maintenance free, and scratches and smudges can be sanded or abraded out with a plastic scrubber. It's also sensitive to heat. Granite should be sealed with a masonry sealer; otherwise it will spot and stain. Use the sealer the granite people give you, or should give you. Stains on granite are difficult, if not impossible, to remove. Corian comes in many styles, colors, and granite look-alikes. Choice of granite ``patterns'' is limited, but they are spectacular.
2078 NYT19990218.0129-13 14 9.295929980085546 false A. No negatives, on Corian and its competitors, in my opinion, except cost. It is expensive. I speak from experience, having owning two Corian vanity tops for at least 10 years. Corian resists absorption of stains and anything else, and stains and other blemishes can be sanded off with fine sandpaper or emory cloth. Scratches can also be sanded off with no adverse effects; it will take a little longer to eliminate scratches. You can use cleansers or abrasive pads, but these will take even longer. Chips, I believe, can be filled with a liquid repair solution and sanded smooth.
2078 NYT19990416.0093-9 15 8.991254483206223 false ``Corian stains badly and scratches easily. Sure you can bleach the stain and sure you can sand the shallow scratches, but then the sanding marks show. So you sand the whole thing and change the surface of the entire piece. The shine/smoothness is gone. And I bet a bacteriologist would have a field day identifying everything that could happily reside in microscopic sandpaper scratches on Corian.

2078 NYT19990416.0093-12 18 8.367831028078644 false Jenny Luongo has some good points, and missed one: Corian is sensitive to heat. However, the finer the sandpaper or Scotch pads, the fewer scratches and the more shine, I think. And even burn marks can be sanded.

2078 NYT20000126.0101-43 20 8.012535291986154 false Unlike stone products such as granite and marble, the quartz composite is nonporous, making it stain and scratch resistant, and its colors are uniform. Unlike solid-surface materials such as Corian, Zodiaq is heat resistant.

They encased the bar at the East Village restaurant Coup in the same rubber used as shock absorbers in bridge construction. The finished bar has the look of unpolished black Corian and the feel of a bicycle grip. Equally surprising is that the deep mahogany colored ``wood'' panels in Coup are made from phenolic resin, a plastic normally used to insulate high-voltage switches.
2078 NYT20000510.0134-0 27 7.107223233726223 false NEW YORK _ There was a time, in the distant '80s, when Corian was such an exotic material it had to be installed by licensed technicians. Now it's just another tired surface at Home Depot, and everyone is lusting for raw concrete countertops that resemble picnic tables at a state penitentiary.
2078 NYT19980807.0297-16 28 6.849264044219748 false The main bar _ which serves mojitos, a Cuban rum drink, and Jennifer's martini, a recipe from Ms. Lopez (Absolut with Madeira) _ is bright and colorful, with orange stained walls, a sky blue ceiling and a luxuriant red Corian bar, recalling 50s Havana.

The rear deck frame is pressure-treated, the deck boards are Trex, a composite material that rarely needs staining or other treatment. The mahogany railing is stained.
2078 NYT19990317.0169-5 30 6.176706753342567 false A. I think that while sanding is good to take scratches and stains off Corian, power-sanding is not. Try steady, overall hand-sanding with the finest sandpaper you can obtain, or emery cloth. Or, use one of those stiff plastic scrubbers of a coarse consistency; the kitchen Scotch pads are not stiff enough. If you are reluctant to do that, call the dealer or Dow, the manufacturer; they might have additional suggestions.
2078 NYT19990603.0152-21 31 5.980942344488713 false Now, there are Corian countertops and beadboard cabinets, a work island with stools, built-in cubbies for appliances, and a huge window above the sink for bird-watching. Chang chose Salt Marsh Pottery from Cape Cod as tiling accent pieces, and the wildflower motifs add just the right splash of color to the yellow and white room.
2078 NYT19990123.0245-5 32 5.709506865748658 false Modular-home manufacturers are also working more closely with their vendors to use just-in-time inventory techniques and bulk-buying power to offer customers the cherry cabinets, Corian counter tops, Jacuzzi tubs and gabled roofs they're looking for at lower prices. Home buyers can maximize their savings by choosing from among factory-stocked amenities rather than special-ordering such items.

2078 NYT19990416.0093-2 34 5.461639130738074 false A. Try a little bleach. Put liquid chlorine bleach on a small spot to see if it works; if it does, then do the whole sink. Or, sand the stains off; that is the standard way to remove stains on Corian. Use the finest sandpaper you can find, and wet the surface first. Or use water and emery cloth. The fineness of the sandpaper or emery will keep scratches to a minimum, the water is a lubricant to help prevent scratching.
2078 NYT20000118.0163-7 35 5.025309960166441 true More are on the way. The new Rosa Mexicano near Lincoln Center will have sinks with rose petals embedded in clear acrylic bowls, designed by David Rockwell.

2078 NYT19981015.0162-12 36 4.71163378868465 false At the start of the great patriotic indoor war on mildew, you can kill the mildew by treating it with a solution of liquid chlorine bleach and water; a 1 to 3 ratio is adequate. This solution will not harm any painted or varnished surfaces, or hard plastic, Corian, granite. It will bleach untreated wood, and will ruin unfast dyed cloth, fabric, and upholstery. If you have to use a bleach solution on such materials, start out with a 1 to 10 ratio, and make a test treatment to see if it will work safely or not.
2078 NYT19990512.0240-1 37 4.383310171496284 false A: Called an undermount sink, this type is more difficult and more time-consuming to install (probably several hours as compared to less than one hour for most self-rimming sinks). The self-rimming sink merely sits on top of the counter with a layer of putty under the rim (except for some stainless models that require a rim). The undermount sink is held in place with a special clamping ring that is screwed to the underside of the counter as shown here. However, there is another problem to consider: an undermount sink is only possible when installed on solid countertop material (granite, Corian or similar material) because the edge of the counter material will be exposed.

2371 NYT19990701.0162-63 0 22.670430955734535 true The only bee that is a nuisance more than a menace is the carpenter bee, which drills a hole in wood siding and trim, turning a corner and depositing eggs in the drilled tunnel.
2371 NYT19991119.0114-16 1 18.248977737877954 true A. Your family doesn't have to do anything because there is nothing to do, if the critters stay in the walls. The yellow jackets are wasps, and they will die out in winter after eating all kinds of bugs all summer long. Your family could seal the soffit to prevent further invasion and to make you feel better. The wasps are not drilling holes in the studs because they don't do that sort of thing. The insect that drills holes in wood is a carpenter bee, and even she (females drill holes to store their eggs in) would drill holes in siding or outside trim.

2371 NYT19990812.0127-8 3 16.965174484775076 true A. You could try cypress, which is not only water resistant but may resist the carpenter bees. Trouble is, it might be impossible to find. Carpenter bees tend to drill into wood boards, then turn a corner inside the wood to lay their eggs. You can treat the hole with an insecticide, then plug it with a piece of putty. That is the only ``cure,'' and it is not a good one because the bees are beneficial, pollinating flowers and vegetables all summer long.
2371 NYT19991216.0073-15 4 15.84207393639962 false One way to curb the wayward bit is to apply a piece of duct tape to the tile or glass. This will hold the drill as you begin. Other handymen have suggested drilling a small hole in a piece of wood, laying the wood on the glass or tile, and using the hole to reduce the drill wobble.
2371 NYT19990514.0155-17 5 15.600127397165783 false Another way: tap the top of the nail head with a nailset to create a pilot hole, then drill a hole into the head, repeating the drilling until you've drilled the head right off. Countersink the shaft and fill with wood filler or a dowel.
2371 NYT19990226.0131-15 6 15.56200161615443 false If this doesn't work, drill a hole through the dent, insert a wood plug, and glue in place.

I have a lot of holes from carpenter bees in the trim of my house, mostly on the rake, the trim board that follows the slope of the roof at the gable ends.

2371 NYT19990604.0124-28 12 14.031189698661132 false Q. A handyman caulked my storm windows and did other jobs around the house, but he also caulked over the weep holes in the storms' bottom frame (an alumnum sill that sits on the wood). Should I drill new holes?
2371 NYT19990108.0135-24 13 13.912481797332223 false Q. You have mentioned drilling holes in a double-glazed window to eliminate the fogging.

2371 NYT20000105.0178-3 14 13.90313218068538 false You can also use a long wood screw to secure a loose baluster. Drill a pilot hole at an angle through the side of the baluster up into the rail. Next, countersink the hole so the screw head will be hidden below the surface of the wood. Driving the screw through the hole should pull the rail and baluster securely together.
2371 NYT19981211.0052-25 15 13.440250264042813 false The key to their match came on No. 8, when they had to take an unplayable lie after Woods' errant tee shot. But Couples' approach cozied up to within eight feet and Woods drilled the putt, earning a half on the hole.

2371 NYT20000629.0121-7 17 13.390289852574158 false OK, if you have to replace the knobs, you can enlarge the small holes with a hole saw, a device that comes in all sizes, including 2 1/8 inch, and attaches to a power drill. While it is a little difficult to make the hole bigger with one of these hole saws than to make it from scratch, you should be able to do it with care. To make it easier, clamp a scrap piece of wood on the door over the existing hole so the bit of the hole saw will start drilling in the right position.

2371 NYT19990310.0286-5 20 13.038293905881893 false Use a carbide-tipped drill bit to bore the hole. Depending on the number of holes, their diameter, and the hardness of the concrete, you may be able to use your 1/4- or 3/8-inch drill for boring the holes. You can, for example, drill six 1/8-inch holes with a standard 1/4-inch drill, but if you have to bore that many 1/2-inch holes in hard concrete, it may be better to rent either a 1/2-inch drill or a hammer drill.

Yes, you can drill holes in concrete. It is not easy, but possible.
2371 NYT19980917.0139-12 33 12.142458361311782 false Professionals do it by removing clapboards or shingles at appropriate places, drilling holes through the sheathing into the wall cavity, inserting a hose into each hole, and filling the cavity. Holes must be drilled between studs at the top and bottom of each stud space, so that means a helluva lot of holes. Can't be helped.
2371 NYT20000608.0094-4 34 12.118842536395436 false Another way to fasten is to drill holes, if the glass is not tempered, and screw the glass top onto the framework with solid brass screws. You can buy special bits for drilling into glass, but I have to repeat: Do not try this on tempered glass; it will explode if tampered with. Or, have a glass company drill the holes for you. And, caveat emptor: There is always a chance of breaking the glass while drilling holes.

2371 NYT19990108.0135-28 43 11.733940387150795 false Drilling the holes allows air to circulate in the cavity, and might clear up the glass, but it is possible that there will be no clearing. In that case, stick a Water Pic in one of the holes and spray the inside with water. This usually works. If nothing clears up the glass, drill two more holes at each top corner.

Make two rows of weep holes where the wall is higher than five or six feet. The impact drill will go through concrete like a knife through butter; an electric drill will take decades to make a hole, even with a masonry bit.
2371 NYT19991021.0182-9 45 11.673768183003784 false Your first priority is to drill some holes in the wall for drainage; weep holes they are. Drill holes a foot or so above the ground, spacing them every 4 feet horizontally. Put other holes 2 feet up from the first row of holes. Make a hole by driving a steel reinforcing bar through the wall. Install copper or sturdy plastic tubing in the holes. Quarter to half inch will do nicely.
2371 NYT19990901.0165-11 46 11.633968818325645 false For making round holes in concrete or stone, use a star drill. This tool has a long hexagonal handle, and a cutting bit is in the shape of a cross or four- pointed star. To drill a hole, hold the tool vertically and strike with a small sledgehammer.
