2296 NYT20000125.0079-5 10 15.787092123121724 false Ironically, in light of the Thomas and Enzi criticism, Devils Tower National Monument in northeast Wyoming was the first national monument to be created in this nation. President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, issued the proclamation in 1906, soon after the passage of the Antiquities Act.
2296 NYT20000111.0295-8 11 15.724627313813345 false The national monuments were designated under authority granted by Congress in the Antiquities Act of 1906. With the four proclamations, Clinton joined President Carter as having set aside more acreage than any president since the act was passed. The only 20th-century presidents not creating national monuments under the act were Nixon, Reagan and Bush.
2296 APW20000616.0038-8 12 15.709354382477247 false Clinton has designated the national monuments under the 1906 Antiquities Act, which allows a president to set aside federal lands as monuments for historic or scientific reasons. Republicans said he had used the law to set aside more land than it intended, was ignoring the will of local members of Congress and other officials, and was using the designation for election-year politics.
2296 NYT20000608.0331-12 13 15.467499724382632 false Clinton has used the 1906 Antiquities Act to designate a series of national monuments in the American West. The law was first used by President Theodore Roosevelt early in the 20th Century to protect such places as the Grand Canyon and the heart of Washington's Olympic Mountains. Both areas are now national parks.
2296 NYT20000421.0268-9 14 15.133578618757554 false Last week Clinton officially designated 328,000 acres in California as a national monument to protect sequoias. It was the fifth time that Clinton had created a monument using the Antiquities Act of 1906, which allows a president to change the status of federal lands that have scientific, historical or architectural significance. He has also expanded an existing monument.

Congress has only abolished six national monuments _ comprising about 5,000 acres in total. One of the abolished monuments was later redesignated as a monument under a different name.

2296 NYT20000904.0036-7 18 14.627590959735269 false It is also true, however, that a monument designation is a quintessentially federal act, imposed from above by the executive branch. Although that is just what Congress intended in 1906 when it passed the Antiquities Act, giving the president unilateral authority to rescue historic sites imperiled by congressional inaction, recent Republican presidents have resisted using it. Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush are the only chief executives since 1906 not to designate at least one monument.
2296 NYT20000605.0128-5 19 14.477566239593006 false Since taking office, Clinton has designated five new national monuments and expanded an already existing one, the Pinnacles National Monument in California.

The monument was converted into a national park by Congress in 1919. Lands adjacent to the Grand Canyon National Park were designated national monuments in 1932 and in 1969. And in 1975, Congress enlarged the park to include those monuments.

2296 NYT20000109.0177-5 25 13.741018019826079 false The second opportunity lies in the Antiquities Act of 1906, a little-known statute that allows presidents, by executive order, to protect public lands by designating them as national monuments. Clinton, who has already set aside nearly two million acres in Utah, is now considering four new monument designations, and is expected to act on at least one of these _ a million-acre monument near the Grand Canyon _ on Tuesday. Every president except Richard Nixon, Reagan and George Bush has used this device in the last 94 years, and not once have the designations been revoked by Congress.
2296 NYT20000511.0419-8 26 13.694876374845194 false However, President Clinton recently used his authority under the 1906 Antiquities Act to designate a 1.1 million acre national monument in Arizona canyonlands adjoining Grand Canyon National Park, and to protect 383,000 acres of giant sequoia trees in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California.

Precisely. The language of the Antiquities Act as passed by Congress back in June 1906 purposely omitted the need to get approval from Congress.
2296 NYT19991212.0215-17 30 13.366004092154094 false Under the 1906 Antiquities Act, pushed through Congress by then-President Theodore Roosevelt, the president has the unilateral power to protect federal lands from development by declaring them national monuments.
2296 APW19990925.0032-5 31 13.310263307942172 false A 1906 law allows a president to create a national monument to   protect an area of historic, archaeological or geologic  significance. President Theodore Roosevelt used it to protect the  Grand Canyon before it became a national park; other national  monuments include the Statue of Liberty and part of what is now  Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.

He said it would be preferable for Congress to establish the monument. But if that fails, Babbitt said, he will recommend that President Clinton use his powers under the 1906 Antiquities Act to establish a monument through an executive action.
2296 NYT20000131.0229-0 36 12.457900699013313 false We can expect President Clinton to designate more national monuments before he leaves office. Public support has been overwhelming for his latest designations.
2296 NYT20000718.0167-10 37 12.22796258617856 false Clinton already has declared 2 million Western acres as national monuments under a 1906 law giving him power to act without the consent of Congress. Opponents worry that he may use that power to declare all or part of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a new monument, making it off-limits to oil companies who want to drill there.
2296 NYT20000605.0128-22 38 12.078375243055582 false If the president designates these sites as national monuments, he will have created or expanded 10 monuments during his administration _ setting aside more than 3.8 million acres for greater protection.
2296 NYT20000829.0040-16 39 12.017164801775213 false In Arizona, 80 percent of the population supports the designation of Aqua Fria National Monument outside of Phoenix.

2296 APW20000718.0035-2 43 11.570307402575573 false Even so, many Westerners have opposed Clinton's use of a 1906 law to add nearly 2 million acres this year alone to the federal lands protected as national monuments. The lands are nearly all in Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington state.
2296 NYT19991214.0411-4 44 11.570307402575573 false The setting was significant.

The tilt is what gives Earth seasons: Summer happens in the northern hemisphere when it is tilted toward the sun.

Some 9,000 years ago, Earth's tilt was 24.14  degrees, compared with the current 23.45 degrees, and the point in  the Earth's orbit that is closest to the sun occurred at the end of  July, as compared with early January now. At that time, the  Northern Hemisphere received more summer sunlight, which amplified  the African and Indian summer monsoon, they reported.

The sperm whale most likely disables it with a focused sonic boom, which enables the mammal to scoop up the stunned cephalopod. Unlike the flesh of its smaller, edible squid cousins, Architeuthis's is saturated with ammonium chloride, which causes it to taste like a mouthful of household cleaner. Some of the rigorously researched pages in ``The Search for the Giant Squid'' contain more data than anyone but the most devoted squid buff could desire. Still, after piling on the facts, Ellis will dash off an evocative sentence urging his reader to ``envision the giant squid lurking almost invisibly in the blackness of the depths, its amazing eyes able to pick out the tiniest light or movement, its muscular tentacles shooting out to capture its unsuspecting prey,'' and send a shiver down your spine, the kind of shiver from which squid mania is born.
