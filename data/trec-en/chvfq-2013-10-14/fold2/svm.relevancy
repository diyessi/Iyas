Seven years before the classic ``Silent Spring,'' the author turned her formidable gaze on the narrow strip of sea bottom that ebbs and flows with the tides, and the rich web of life thriving along the Atlantic coastline. ``Carson's book is beautifully written,'' Jonathan N.

1899 NYT19981231.0086-19 48 10.852863350140296 true Rachel Carson, best known for her book ``Silent Spring,'' died of breast cancer in 1964. It is no great surprise that her writing still sparkles after all this time; she was as much a perfectionist in her writing as in her science. Linda Lear's collection of her essays does a superb job of pulling from Carson's works a collection that is lyric, descriptive, informative and moving. The surprise is that Carson's scientific brilliance still shines. The engaging pieces in ``Lost Woods'' include a discussion of how evolution continues today, a warning on the hazards to island ecosystems and an analysis of cloud formations that accompanied a 1957 television program. The most scientific and politically powerful piece in this collection is Carson's speech attacking the detractors of ``Silent Spring,'' delivered shortly before her death, giving example after example of the damage being done through bioconcentration of contaminants moving through food chains and transportation of contaminants across distances in animals; it ends with her declaration that humans should be viewed as animals whose well-being is tightly tied to the condition of their environment. This book should be required reading both for corporate managers in environmentally sensitive industries and for environmentalists and environmental scientists, who deserve the inspiration of Carson's finely wrought, passionate prose. _ BILL SHARP

2381 NYT19990210.0007-6 1 13.830656726167247 false Making Hamlet so brawny has telling effects on Horatio and Laertes. Horatio (Joe Corey) is a kind of crumpled good old boy who turns up when needed, and this notion works quite well until the end, when ``good night, sweet prince'' sounds peculiarly soppy in his mouth. For Laertes (Matthew D. Barton), the toughening of Hamlet levels the field. When Hamlet is a brooding intellectual, Laertes always seems just a youthful victim. Here Hamlet is no smarter than Laertes, and Laertes' plotting with Claudius to poison Hamlet makes both young men seekers of blood vengeance fated to kill each other.
2381 NYT20000509.0112-3 2 12.70164588643686 true Then there is Posa, who has reminded some of Hamlet's schoolmate Horatio, the beloved friend to whom the prince can bare his soul. The resemblance, if granted, is rather strained. Horatio is a witness, Posa a provocateur _ one, moreover, who to his own astonishment captures the eye and heart of his friend's mortal enemy, the king. The position is, of course, untenable.

2194 APW19980610.1298-2 0 16.366075976741065 false First of all you must be aware how much the brake pedal sinks every time you brake (which is simply the distance between the brake pads and the discs). In other words, if the distance increases, that means that the brake pads are wearing out. Another way to check the brake pads, especially in cars with disc brakes, is the amount of brake oil remaining in the cylinder in the engine. The wearing out of the pads will result in the oil filling that space. So if there is little brake oil left, the pads are worn out as much.
2194 NYT19981221.0066-6 1 15.492261083554322 false Either the brake rotor or drum rotates with the wheel. The stopping action of the wheel is achieved when the friction material attached to a brake shoe (for drum brakes) or brake pad (disk brakes) is forced against the spinning drum or disk. There are two brake shoes or brake pads used at each wheel.
2194 NYT19981228.0099-4 2 13.86058497985223 false Every time you apply the brakes and the brake pads and shoes contact the rotors and drums, a little bit of brake lining material is worn away. To compensate for the wear, it takes more fluid to fill the hydraulic cylinder down at the wheel and push the piston against the brake pad. Consequently, you have to push farther to make the car stop.
2194 APW19980610.1298-4 3 13.825299187355641 false Brake pads for drum brakes have a longer life, usually about three times of those for discs. The reason is that drums have a much larger contact area.
2194 NYT19981228.0099-7 4 13.706178044352683 false This device is actually a piece of soft metal attached to the brake pad. As the pads wear down, the metal contacts the rotor and starts chirping while the car is rolling. Its job is to warn the driver the brakes are at the wear limit. When you apply the brakes, the noise should diminish.
2194 APW19980610.1298-3 5 13.399871604473251 false If you see the brake warning bulb light up on the dashboard, even though the handbrake has been released, and the brake oil level is lower than usual, it's likely that the brake pads have been worn out and it's time to replace them.
2194 NYT19981221.0066-11 6 13.044868005913678 false In a disc-brake system, the fluid pressure moves the piston against the back of the brake pad, forcing it against the spinning rotor. This action causes the wheel to stop.
2194 NYT19990104.0111-1 7 12.955349962019252 false The constant heating and cooling of the brake rotor as the brakes are applied and released eventually causes the flat rotor to warp (like leaving a vinyl record in the sun). When you step on the brake pedal, the pads clamp against the high spot on the rotor. As the low spot rotates around, the pads need to move again to clamp it.
2194 APW19990729.0283-5 8 12.573476186861186 false Owners with the high-performance brake pads should also get   high-performance brake hoses which use steel to better dissipate  the heat, Ford officials said. Those types of hoses are available  from Ford dealers.
2194 NYT19981228.0099-13 9 12.526449314832954 false With the typical stop-and-go metro driving, the life of the average front brake pads is about 25,000 to 30,000 miles.
2194 NYT19981228.0099-9 10 12.245861218943293 false Design and simple physics do 65 to 75 percent of a car's braking by the front brakes.

2194 NYT19990104.0111-2 11 12.206108196619667 false The pads must move in and out to keep contact with the distorted rotor. This causes the uneven braking action to be felt through your foot.

2194 NYT19981228.0099-5 18 10.993803824891879 false Check the brake fluid level in the master cylinder (usually a white plastic container with black caps under the hood, in front of the steering wheel). If the fluid is low in one or both of the sections and there are no leaks in the system, it is a pretty good indication your brake pads and or shoes are worn.
2194 NYT20000517.0184-8 19 10.947987040464028 false Artificial pads are made from polyurethane foam and are less expensive than natural pads. Artificial pads are called either prime or rebonded, depending on the composition of the polyurethane in them. Prime pads are made with urethane of one consistency in varying thicknesses from one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch. Thickness is not as important, however, as density. Dense pads tend to be firmer and more durable than an open pad.
2194 NYT19981228.0099-8 20 10.902685619656825 false If the brake pad continues to wear, the noise will escalate to a scraping/squealing and eventually a metallic grinding, meaning the lining material is completely worn off and the metal part of the pad is eating into the rotor. This is a dangerous condition and an expensive repair.

A team of scientists led by an astronomer from the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., has completed a survey of 800 stars called Cepheid Variables, and it indicates that the universe is probably between 12 billion and 13.5 billion years old. These are comforting numbers if only because they mean that the universe is not younger than the stars within it, a result that earlier estimates had absurdly suggested. But for most of us, these are still problematic numbers. Something about reasoning in billions makes us dizzy. Previous estimates of the universe's age ranged from 10 billion to 20 billion years. For some reason, this does not sound like a very broad range of numbers, though in fact a universe that is 20 billion years old is twice as old as one that is merely 10 billion years old.

1763 NYT19990609.0289-52 47 6.70628680352386 true How the scientists figured out the universe is expanding is really complicated. Basically, it involved sending up the Hubble space telescope whose sole purpose was to peer deep into universe. Unfortunately, someone screwed up the main lens of the Hubble and so for several years, scientists explored the universe through what essentially was a hellishly expensive Coke bottle. Then NASA sent a team of astro-optometrists or something into space to install a glorified contact lens on the Hubble. That allowed the telescope to really get cracking. What Hubble found was that the universe is big. Really big. Really big and really old. Before Hubble, scientists thought the universe was only about 10 billion years old, which was weird because they knew that certain stars actually were 12 billion years old. When people asked how stars could be older than the universe, the scientists just got sullen and testy. But the Hubble proved that the universe is at least 12 billion years old, so the scientists were lucky there.

1665 NYT20000725.0074-25 7 15.267948841902147 true There are myriad reasons to strut a bit. Here's one: the ballad of Marian Anderson, a onetime South Philadelphia High School student. She was a little Negro girl with a glorious singing voice even as a child. She became a leading contralto, traveled the world. In 1939 she was denied an opportunity to play Constitution Hall in the nation's capital; it was largely understood that the Daughters of the American Revolution orchestrated the snub. The Roosevelt administration arranged for Anderson to sing at the Lincoln Memorial that year. She sang before 75,000. Old men and women got choked up. Little Marian Anderson's voice flew like birds. And there she was, a symbol, a civil right unto herself, a native of the city where the Declaration of Independence was signed, where the Liberty Bell cracked tolling the death of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835.

It was a tribute to the breadth of Mrs. Roosevelt's causes and the nature of her associations that she attracted the attentions of J. Edgar Hoover.

With the invention of the phonograph, by Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner, and its subsequent development, it became possible in for all the music of the past, and most of the music of the world's cultures, to become simultaneously present in the ear and imagination of a composer. The phonograph played a major role in awakening interest in unknown music; and so did efforts after World War II, centered in Boston, to build authentic copies of historical instruments like the harpsichord.

1878 NYT20000302.0254-5 48 8.132611505249923 false The dearth of contemporary intermediate-level works has several possible explanations. In earlier times amateur music-making flourished even in middle-class households: if you wanted music in your daily life you had to make it yourself. That once-vibrant tradition has never recovered from the invention of the radio and the phonograph. Another factor may be the increasing complexity and specialization of 20th-century music, which has tended to put off audiences and isolate composers.

And it shows, because baseballs are flying out of the park at record speeds this year. If I'm a pitcher standing on that mound, I don't want that batter digging in and owning the plate. You've got to throw inside and shave the inside plate. If not, the batters will continue their slugfest.''

Counterfeiters occasionally plate 1943 steel pennies with copper and try to pass them off as rare. If your penny passes the magnet test, take it to a reputable dealer, who will have it authenticated by the American Numismatic Association. While you are sorting through change, look for a mint error dollar coin (Sacagawea on the reverse and a Washington quarter on the obverse).

Her father, for whom she had a strong attachment, was a federal patent attorney. He died when Marjorie was 17; and ``not his life, but his character'' has been reflected in many of her fictional creations.

After their divorce she had more freedom to write, and won a Scribner's contest with a long story titled ``Jacob's Ladder.'' It caught the attention of the great Scribner editor Maxwell Perkins, already fabled as the publishing catalyst for Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe. But in the reading of ``Editor to Author,'' a collection of Perkins' correspondence with his prodigies, it's easy to believe that Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings was the ``discovery'' of whom Perkins was proudest.

By mixing the tight-lipped empirical inventory with fantasy stories, he helped give birth to the visual style of American movies. The movies, after all, are a form where pinpoint exactitude and elaborately engineered fantasy are not just the goal but the given _ all there is. Wyeth's influence on the movies has been immense. Douglas Fairbanks begged him to come out to Hollywood, and the style of Fairbanks's ``Robin Hood'' and ``Thief of Bagdad'' is impossible to imagine without Wyeth's example; even the 1946 film of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings's novel ``The Yearling'' closely follows the design of Wyeth's illustrations.

1521 NYT20000830.0172-5 7 14.384832036639512 false More surprising is the failure of ``The Ellis Island Experience'' to emphasize the changing dynamic of immigration.
