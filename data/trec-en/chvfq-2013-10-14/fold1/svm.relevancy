And they are also an invasive unicolonial species. But unlike Argentine ants, which spread slowly without help from humans and took a century to spread throughout most of coastal California, fire ant queens and winged males take nuptial flights and establish new far-flung colonies. They have invaded California just in the last few years. And they are even meaner than Argentine ants.

They have been surprised to find so many examples, at Upsilon Andromedae and also among the solitary planet detections around other stars, of Jupiter-class objects existing much closer to their stars than Jupiter is to the sun. And none of the current theories predicted what they discovered at Upsilon Andromedae: that three such giant worlds could form and survive around a single star.

Although people generally say the moon is a quarter-million miles (250,000 miles) away from Earth, the distance actually varies because the moon's orbit around Earth is not a circle but an oval, which resembles a slightly flattened circle. At its ''perigee,'' the closest approach to Earth, the moon is 221,456 miles away. At its ``apogee,'' the greatest distance from Earth, the moon is 252,711 miles away.

The highest tides occur at new and full moon, when the Earth, Moon and Sun are approximately aligned. But several effects can cause even higher tides. When the Moon is at perigee, its closest approach to Earth, the gravitational pull is greater and the tides are higher.

Visible from many distant vantage points, it gives the city an emotional and a physical scale as well as a suitably fractured scale of time. A spiral ramp winds within the dome. Accessible to the public, the ramp conveys the idea that citizens can keep an eye on government proceedings. Viewed from outside, the spiral suggests another meaning, perhaps more apt: history does not unfold in linear fashion. And where is the point of orientation that would let a person or a people judge whether a turn is for better or worse?

Currently, when a fiber optic cable carrying dozens of different wavelengths of light reaches an electronic switch, each wavelength must take a different path through the switch. As optical cables evolve to handle more and more wavelengths, which is crucial in expanding capacity, electronic switches must be reconfigured or replaced. But the newest MEMS switches, once installed, can redirect 10 wavelengths or hundreds without needing to be changed or expanded.

In practice, since many signals at different wavelengths are traveling simultaneously down each fiber, the MEMS package requires a device that separates the arriving wavelengths and directs each to a different mirror so that it can be switched to its specific destination. The system also requires a similar device to intercept and rebundle the switched signals so that each outgoing fiber also carries as many different wavelengths as possible.

A frequent complaint about opera in English translation is that the words cannot be understood from the stage, especially in huge houses, a problem that has been compounded over the years because opera singers have so few opportunities to acquire skill for singing in English. And audiences, for their part, have grown unaccustomed to paying attention.

How could they not? On first impression, Stein's text is delightfully wacky, and Thomson's score seems a crazy quilt of hymn tunes, parlor songs, bugle calls, ditties and stretches of what Thomson called his Missouri plainchant.

The three even-numbered movements are called ``Love,'' ``Time'' and ``Death.'' The odd-numbered movements are preoccupied with traveling, the sea, and birds of flight, she explained. The text about love is from the Arab poet Abu Said, who lived at the beginning of this millennium. The text about death is from a traditional mortuary lament of African Pygmies. And the text about time is a single sentence from a novel by the French-Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf, with whom Ms. Saariaho is writing an opera.
1583 NYT20000123.0057-12 24 9.134327954286292 false In defining the musical too much emphasis is accorded the genre's mix of spoken text and song. Many operas do this, too, notably ``Carmen'' and ``Fidelio.'' The inclusion of dialogue does not turn these operas into proto-musicals. Even ``The Magic Flute,'' which Mozart wrote for a people's theater, is thoroughly an opera, with complex ensembles, sublime arias and, in the duet of the two men in armor, an evocation of Baroque sacred music.

In the myth, Orpheus has such mastery over his art that he can use it to suspend natural law and descend into Hades. But Monteverdi's attitude toward Orpheus' musical powers is more ambiguous. The composer wrote this opera at a moment of heated debate in Italy about the nature of music: should music or text take priority? Monteverdi believed that music had already gone too far in eclipsing its texts. It had become overly introverted, intricate, indulgent. In creating one of the first modern operas based on his understanding of classical ideals, Monteverdi wanted music to serve the text, not dominate it. It would have to acknowledge an external authority.
