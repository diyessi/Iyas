15 15-2 3 1.0 true Mr Malcolm Hutchinson , DLR managing director , is determined to avoid the breakdowns and delays which followed the opening of the first 7 1/2 miles of the railway in 1987 .
15 15-3 4 1.0 false But the fact that London Transport - the premier urban transport operator in the country - had been thinking about street-running tramways in the early 1980s altered perceptions of the idea elsewhere in the country .

15 15-12 13 1.0 false Detailed planning is underway on the first 21km route , which will use an old railway alignment between the centre of Birmingham and Wolverhampton - 1995 is the best bet for an opening date .

15 15-17 18 1.0 false The government is keen to press ahead with the plan because it wants the private sector to build a Pounds 130m extension of the Docklands Light Railway across the Thames to Lewisham in south-east London .

15 15-25 26 1.0 false The trains have been operating without passengers as software and signalling systems controlling the railway have been tested .
15 15-26 27 1.0 false This was partly because it was designed when Docklands was still planned as an area of housing and light industry and before the building of Canary Wharf turned it into a high-rise office centre .
15 15-27 28 1.0 false The Beckton extension will bring a large part of east London within easy reach of the line and take the railway within a few hundred yards of the City airport .
15 15-28 29 1.0 false In a hangover from the poor transport planning which has bedevilled Docklands development , there will still be no station in the airport terminal .
15 15-29 30 1.0 false By the end of this year the DLR expects to choose a private consortium to carry out a Pounds 100m extension of the railway across the Thames .
15 15-30 31 1.0 false The Lewisham spur is due to be completed by 1997 , the year before the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Line extension provides a direct underground link between Docklands and the West End of London .
