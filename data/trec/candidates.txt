100 100-3 4 1.0 true Even then , Hurricane Andrew was by far the most costly catastrophe which the US property-casualty insurance sector has faced .
100 100-4 5 1.0 true In the US , Hurricane Andrew - which ripped through Florida and Louisiana in August 1992 and was the nation 's costliest disaster -brought a insurance bill of USDollars 15bn -LRB- Pounds 10bn -RRB- .

100 100-6 7 1.0 true Hurricane Andrew , which tore through Florida in August 1992 , was the costliest US catastrophe with losses of more than Dollars 16bn .
100 100-7 8 1.0 false THERE are growing signs that Hurricane Andrew , unwelcome as it was for the devastated inhabitants of Florida and Louisiana , may in the end do no harm to the re-election campaign of President George Bush .
100 100-8 9 1.0 false US insurers expect to pay out around Dollars 500m in claims as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in Louisiana , the American Insurance Services Group said yesterday , Nikki Tait reports .
100 100-9 10 1.0 false However , the final cost of Hurricane Andrew will be higher still .
100 100-10 11 1.0 false Hurricane Hugo , which hit the east coast in September 1989 , cost the insurance industry about Dollars 4.2bn .
100 100-11 12 1.0 false With Florida 's Hurricane Andrew losses added in , the total rises to Dollars 11.2bn .
100 100-12 13 1.0 false This easily exceeds the record Dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in 1989 , when the industry paid out on both Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta earthquake in California .
100 100-13 14 1.0 false A LEADING US insurance company yesterday estimated that the industry could face losses of around Dollars 8bn to Dollars 10bn as a result of Hurricane Andrew , which left a five-day trail of destruction in Florida and Louisiana .
100 100-14 15 1.0 false HURRICANE Andrew , claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history , yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana , inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans .
100 100-15 16 1.0 false Hurricane Hugo , which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989 , cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn .
100 100-16 17 1.0 false THE US insurance industry expects to pay out Dollars 10.2bn in claims to victims of Hurricane Andrew , which ripped through southern Florida and Louisiana in late August .
100 100-17 18 1.0 false One reason for believing the insurance cycle should turn following the Hurricane Andrew losses is that property-casualty insurers are believed to be carrying lower levels of catastrophe reinsurance than they were a few years ago .
100 100-18 19 1.0 false The annual results were boosted by significantly lower catastrophe losses last year than in 1992 when the insurance industry paid out large sums following Hurricane Andrew and other big disasters .
100 100-19 20 1.0 false Discussions at the meeting focussed on the experience of Florida , which faced a similar insurance crisis after the devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew .

100 100-24 25 1.0 false Although there had already been some preliminary guesses at the level of insurance claims , yesterday 's figure comes from the Property Claims Services division of the American Insurance Services Group , the property-casualty insurers ' trade association .
100 100-25 26 1.0 false It follows an extensive survey of the area by the big insurance companies .
100 100-26 27 1.0 false Mr Gary Kerney , director of catastrophe services at the PCS , said the industry was expecting about 685,000 claims in Florida alone .
100 100-27 28 1.0 false By contrast , insurance claims resulting from the Los Angeles riots earlier this year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the US - totalled just Dollars 775m .
100 100-28 29 1.0 false The property-casualty industry is thought to have adequate reserves to cover the disaster .
100 100-29 30 1.0 false Some of those affected by the disaster claim that relief efforts have been disorganised , and that much-needed supplies have been slow to arrive .
100 100-30 31 1.0 false On the insurance front , estimates of the industry 's losses have varied in recent days , but a consensus seems to be forming around the Dollars 10bn figure .
100 100-31 32 1.0 false The new estimate , released yesterday by the Property Claims Services division of the American Insurance Service Group , an industry trade association , represents an increase from the original assessment of Dollars 7.8bn .
100 100-32 33 1.0 false Many Wall Street analysts are suggesting the scale of the losses could prompt a turn in the US property-casualty industry cycle which would allow insurance companies to push up rates and move closer to making underwriting profits .

100 100-36 37 1.0 false Andrew in particular , which with losses of more than Dollars 15bn is the US 's costliest natural disaster , has been a decisive factor prompting some reinsurance companies to leave the market .

100 100-43 44 1.0 false That said , insurers admit that it is still hard to assess the degree to which affected homeowners may have been either under-insured or without insurance altogether .
100 100-44 45 1.0 false Mr Maurice Greenberg , chairman , said the strong quarterly and annual results reflected the increase in operating income reported by all of AIG 's three main businesses - general insurance , life insurance and financial services .

100 100-54 55 1.0 false That catastrophe cost the insurance industry more than Dollars 15bn , prompting insurers to abandon offering hurricane insurance in the state .
100 100-55 56 1.0 false Zurich Insurance , the large Swiss company , owns a stake in Mr Sandor 's company , and others , including two UK brokers - Sedgwick and Willis Corroon - are also exploring the potential .
100 100-56 57 1.0 false Underpinning the interest is the conviction that the capital base of the orthodox insurance and reinsurance industry is increasingly inadequate to cope with the scale of catastrophic risks , a fact graphically demonstrated by disasters in the US .
100 100-57 58 1.0 false Claims on a loss warranty policy are triggered by two sets of losses : those on the insurance policy of the buyer , and industry-wide claims .

15 15-3 4 1.0 false But the fact that London Transport - the premier urban transport operator in the country - had been thinking about street-running tramways in the early 1980s altered perceptions of the idea elsewhere in the country .
15 15-4 5 1.0 false By the late 1980s , with construction underway on the Manchester system , cities and towns throughout the UK began to see the modern tram as the solution to their transport ills .
15 15-5 6 1.0 false THE OPENING of the Manchester light rail system sees trams finally return to the streets of Britain 's great cities .

15 15-17 18 1.0 false The government is keen to press ahead with the plan because it wants the private sector to build a Pounds 130m extension of the Docklands Light Railway across the Thames to Lewisham in south-east London .

15 15-25 26 1.0 false The trains have been operating without passengers as software and signalling systems controlling the railway have been tested .
15 15-26 27 1.0 false This was partly because it was designed when Docklands was still planned as an area of housing and light industry and before the building of Canary Wharf turned it into a high-rise office centre .
15 15-27 28 1.0 false The Beckton extension will bring a large part of east London within easy reach of the line and take the railway within a few hundred yards of the City airport .

17 17-10 11 1.0 false This year , a moment before he is to enter the hearing room , Manson abruptly decides that he is having none of this legally mandated but manifestly futile ritual .

17 17-34 35 1.0 false Reinforced by Dino Fulgoni , the office expert on the since-outlawed `` diminished capacity '' defense , Kay recovered with a 1978 third- trial guilty verdict .

33 33-5 6 1.0 false Berliner Bank had long urged the merger with Landesbank Berlin and Berliner Pfandbrief - Bank , but the city , anxious to protect its stake in Berliner Bank , delayed the move .
33 33-6 7 1.0 false Mr Norbert Meisner , Berlin 's economics secretary , said earlier that the merger would create a bank large enough to provide the increased investment needs in Berlin and the surrounding Brandenburg state .

33 33-14 15 1.0 false An immediate opinion poll in the city showed the Social Democrats gaining just 40 per cent of the votes , compared with 48 per cent in 1991 .
33 33-15 16 1.0 false The fact that the city party has been found guilty of undemocratic procedures in its own candidate selection seems likely to lose it further support .

35 35-4 5 1.0 false The incessant rain that never falls on Kilimanjaro in February had been replaced by the driving snow that so rarely dusts its upper slopes , according to the notes on the Ordnance Survey map .
35 35-5 6 1.0 false The huge volcanic cone of Kilimanjaro remained invisible above and below us .
35 35-6 7 1.0 false The sun rose behind the science-fiction peak of Mawenzi , Kilimanjaro 's little sister .
35 35-7 8 1.0 false But then , to our great relief , it became clear why Kilimanjaro had to be climbed at night .
35 35-8 9 1.0 false Yet we had 'done ' Kilimanjaro .
35 35-9 10 1.0 false This is because Kilimanjaro shoots abruptly up out of a 3 , 000ft plain .

35 35-11 12 1.0 false For Jim and me , dilettante backpackers and runners , the five-day , 52-mile Kilimanjaro ascent was a test of will and endurance .
35 35-12 13 1.0 false Kilimanjaro is a Tanzanian national park , and each climbing party is required to have a guide who in turn provisions and cooks for the expedition .
35 35-13 14 1.0 false Like most Kilimanjaro climbers , we elected to do the ascent Himalayan style , with porters carrying all but day packs .
35 35-14 15 1.0 false Since the 1840s , when missionaries and geologists began trying to climb Kilimanjaro , mountaineering has become a major source of income and employment for the region .
35 35-15 16 1.0 false The entrance to the park was crowded with Americans , Japanese , Australians and Europeans , some seeking climbing permits , others returning from successful -LRB- or abortive -RRB- attempts to reach Kilimanjaro 's summit .
35 35-16 17 1.0 false The first leg of the expedition was a 5-mile climb through a rain forest that girdles Kilimanjaro at 6,000 to 9,500 feet .
35 35-17 18 1.0 false -LRB- The Kilimanjaro massif rises out of a plain that is about 3,500 feet above sea level .
35 35-18 19 1.0 false Kilimanjaro climbers can go for the summit on a five - or six-day trip or spend a day or so wandering trails on the lower reaches .

35 35-27 28 1.0 false The mountain veiled itself again , and stayed hidden from us , bar the odd glimpse , for the next four days .
35 35-28 29 1.0 false Of the 50 other climbers who had been attempting the separate 'tourist ' route up the mountain that night , just two stumbled with us to this true summit .
35 35-29 30 1.0 false The equatorial sun , grilling down on us with pure ultra-violet , had melted the top of the mountain into a great , barely climbable mound of white slush and black volcanic sand .
35 35-30 31 1.0 false We reached the highest tourist refuge , Kibo Huts , at lunchtime and collapsed on to grubby bunks for a brief doze .
35 35-31 32 1.0 false We had avoided the normal , much-trodden Marangu route up the mountain and had taken the more beautiful Machame trail .
35 35-32 33 1.0 false Although professional climbers sometimes scoff at the mountain as being `` technically unchallenging , '' the altitude and cold -- as many of our companions discovered -- proved otherwise .
35 35-33 34 1.0 false Built by the British in the late 1940s , the Moshi Hotel bears its pre-independence name -- the Livingstone Hotel -- in large stucco letters on the cornice .
35 35-34 35 1.0 false There is a danger of not getting one -- especially in August when the mountain is so crowded .
35 35-35 36 1.0 false This portion of the mountain is almost perpetually covered with dense , low-lying clouds below which lichen- and creeper-shrouded trees and grasses have adapted to life with little sunlight .
35 35-36 37 1.0 false -LRB- In World War I a troop of German soldiers , trapped behind relentlessly advancing British troops , surrendered at the cave after having hidden out on the mountain for eight months -RRB- .

37 37-0 1 1.0 true The North Koreans have insisted that the two US pilots - one of whom was killed when their helicopter came down - were on a spying mission and they published a 'confession ' from Mr Hall .
37 37-1 2 1.0 true At the time of the shooting-down , Mr Hall thought he was over South Korea and apparently did not realise his helicopter had been struck and that Mr Hilemon had been hit , the official said .
37 37-2 3 1.0 false The two -man crew comprised chief warrant officer Bobby Hall and his co-pilot chief warrant officer David Hilemon , who was killed .
37 37-3 4 1.0 false The pilot , Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall , crossed the border at Panmunjom into South Korea .
37 37-4 5 1.0 false In his ambiguous confession , Mr Hall admitted that his reconnaissance helicopter made an 'intrusion deep ' into North Korean airspace , adding 'this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable ' .
37 37-5 6 1.0 false Mr Hall 's statement said his helicopter 'deviated ' from its planned flight route within South Korea , but gave no explanation why it strayed across the demilitarised zone into the North .
37 37-6 7 1.0 false But some South Korean government analysts believe Mr Hall 's statement that it was on an 'observation reconnaissance ' mission could be interpreted as espionage if North Korea decides to press the affair .
37 37-7 8 1.0 false Analysts were divided over whether the statement by Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall would speed his release or provide Pyongyang with new grounds to detain him in return for possible concessions from the US .
37 37-8 9 1.0 false Mr Hall admitted that his OH-58 reconnaissance helicopter made an 'intrusion deep ' into North Korean airspace , adding 'this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable ' .
37 37-9 10 1.0 false Mr Hall 's statement said that his helicopter 'deviated ' from its planned flight route within South Korea , but gave no explanation for why the helicopter strayed across the demilitarised zone .
37 37-10 11 1.0 false But some South Korean government analysts believe that Mr Hall 's statement that the helicopter was on an 'observation reconnaissance ' mission could be interpreted as espionage if North Korea decided to press the affair .
37 37-11 12 1.0 false Chief Warrant Officer Hall reported that after he brought the craft to the ground , he pulled his gravely wounded co-pilot , Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon , from the aircraft , according to a US government official .
37 37-12 13 1.0 false Mr Hall told officials that Mr Hilemon died a short time later , the official said .
37 37-13 14 1.0 false Mr Hall said he was well treated in captivity , the official said .
37 37-14 15 1.0 false North Korea yesterday returned Mr Hall yesterday .
37 37-15 16 1.0 false The return of Mr Hall was the result of a diplomatic compromise .
37 37-16 17 1.0 false However , North Korea appeared satisfied by a 'confession ' signed by Mr Hall , which described the 'illegal intrusion ' as a 'criminal action ' and asked for forgiveness by Pyongyang .
37 37-17 18 1.0 false The official news agency quoted Hall as saying : 'I admit that this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable .
37 37-18 19 1.0 false North Korea yesterday refused to hold a meeting requested by the US to discuss the return of a US pilot and the body of his co-pilot killed in the crash of their army helicopter in North Korea .
37 37-19 20 1.0 false The announcement appeared to dash hopes that North Korea would try to resolve the incident quickly .
37 37-20 21 1.0 false Mr James Laney , the US ambassador to Pyongyang , said in Atlanta he believed North Korea would release the crew quickly rather than risk endangering relations .
37 37-21 22 1.0 false North Korean officials explained that their leadership was 'too busy with the investigation ' into the incident to hold talks on the pilot 's release , according to a spokesman for the US military in Seoul .
37 37-22 23 1.0 false North Korea 's rejection of the US talks proposal could reflect deep divisions within the North Korean leadership on how to resolve the issue .
37 37-23 24 1.0 false A long delay in solving the issue of the helicopter crash will increase pressure in Washington for the US to take a tougher stance on aid to North Korea .
37 37-24 25 1.0 false The two -man OH-58 reconnaissance helicopter crashed on Saturday , three miles north of the eastern end of the demilitarised zone that divides North from South Korea .
37 37-25 26 1.0 false The North Koreans claim that they shot down the helicopter , but the US says that it may have had to make an emergency landing after straying across the demilitarised zone because of a navigational error .
37 37-26 27 1.0 false One explanation for Pyongyang 's rejection of the proposed talks could be that the US wants to discuss the pilot 's release through the military armistice commission which supervises the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean war .
37 37-27 28 1.0 false The resumption of commission meetings on the issue would represent a setback to North Korea 's diplomatic strategy .
37 37-28 29 1.0 false North Korea appears to be using the presence of Mr Richardson as a conduit to resolve the incident .
37 37-29 30 1.0 false Mr Richardson , a Democratic representative from New Mexico , was originally scheduled to hold talks on the nuclear programme accord before he was thrust into an unexpected role of trying to arrange the return of the pilot .
37 37-30 31 1.0 false North Korea early today released a US airman whose helicopter went down over the communist state nearly two weeks ago .
37 37-31 32 1.0 false His release appeared to defuse the fresh diplomatic row that flared up between Pyongyang and Washington only two months after they had finalised an accord on the North 's nuclear programme .
37 37-32 33 1.0 false A Washington official said the US had expressed 'sincere regret ' for the helicopter 's violation of North Korean air space .
37 37-33 34 1.0 false It agreed to hold contacts with the North in an 'appropriate forum ' to prevent similar incidents in the future .
37 37-34 35 1.0 false But North Korea could well press for separate bilateral talks .
37 37-35 36 1.0 false But any further delay in his release might have increased chances of the new Republican -controlled US Congress trying to block implementation of the US nuclear accord with North Korea .
37 37-36 37 1.0 false The pilot 's apology may have provided a face-saving means for his release while allowing North Korea to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes and justify its downing of the helicopter .
37 37-37 38 1.0 false The statement , if it was dictated by North Korean officials as many believe , did not offer much support for Pyongyang 's allegation that the helicopter was on a spying mission and that its intrusion was deliberate .
37 37-38 39 1.0 false This could imply support for the US claim that the helicopter lost its way due to a navigational error .
37 37-39 40 1.0 false North Korea may possibly exploit the incident to support its demand that the US sign a formal treaty ending the 1950-53 Korean war and begin withdrawing its 37,000 troops from South Korea .
37 37-40 41 1.0 false An ambiguous 'confession ' signed by a US army helicopter pilot captured by North Korea almost two weeks ago could further complicate efforts to secure his release .
37 37-41 42 1.0 false If his return is delayed further , it is likely to increase prospects that the new Republican -controlled US Congress will try to block implementation of the recent US nuclear accord with North Korea .
37 37-42 43 1.0 false The apology may provide a face-saving means for his release , while allowing North Korea to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes and justify its downing of the helicopter .
37 37-43 44 1.0 false The statement , if it was dictated by North Korean officials as many believe , does not offer much support for Pyongyang 's allegation that the helicopter was on a spying mission and that its intrusion was deliberate .
37 37-44 45 1.0 false This could imply support for the US claim that the helicopter lost its way after a navigational error .
37 37-45 46 1.0 false Whether North Korea will try to use the issue to gain concessions from the US is still unclear as it negotiates with a senior US diplomat who has travelled to Pyongyang to gain the pilot 's release .
37 37-46 47 1.0 false His release appeared to ensure that the recent US - North Korean nuclear agreement will proceed smoothly after Washington warned earlier that his continued detention could jeopardise the accord .
37 37-47 48 1.0 false Under the nuclear accord , the US has promised to establish diplomatic ties with North Korea and guarantee international aid if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear programme .
37 37-48 49 1.0 false The US expressed regret for the intrusion of the helicopter into North Korean airspace , which Washington said was an accident caused by a navigational error .
37 37-49 50 1.0 false The US did not offer a formal apology as demanded by North Korea , which claimed the helicopter was on a spy mission .
37 37-50 51 1.0 false North Korea claimed the US had agreed to further bilateral military contacts to prevent future incidents .
37 37-51 52 1.0 false A senior US diplomat arrived in Pyongyang yesterday to seek the release of a US army pilot whose detention by North Korea threatens its recent nuclear agreement with Washington .
37 37-52 53 1.0 false Pyongyang claims the helicopter was on a spying mission and the North has demanded an acknowledgement of guilt and an apology from the US .
37 37-53 54 1.0 false Last night North Korea said the pilot had confessed to intruding deep into its territory on a reconnaissance mission and had asked for forgiveness .
37 37-54 55 1.0 false Washington said the helicopter flew into North Korea because of a navigational error .
37 37-55 56 1.0 false Analysts believe other reasons may account for North Korea 's reluctance to release the pilot .
37 37-56 57 1.0 false One possibility is that North Korea is trying to exploit the incident to gain new concessions from the US .
37 37-57 58 1.0 false North Korea could argue that the helicopter incident underscores the need for such a peace treaty .
37 37-58 59 1.0 false The US also agreed to guarantee international aid , including the supply of safer light-water reactors , if North Korea dismantled its current nuclear programme , which is suspected of producing weapons-grade plutonium .
37 37-59 60 1.0 false However , such a diplomatic strategy carries risks for North Korea since US congressional critics of the nuclear agreement may use the continued detention of the pilot as a reason to block the deal .
37 37-60 61 1.0 false US critics of the accord believe that it offers too many concessions to North Korea .
37 37-61 62 1.0 false Senator Bob Dole , who is soon to become US Senate majority leader , was quoted yesterday as calling the agreement 'a lousy deal ' and adding , 'you ca n't trust the North Koreans ' .
37 37-62 63 1.0 false Even so , the delay may also reflect deep divisions between North Korea leaders over the nuclear agreement .
37 37-63 64 1.0 false Mr Thomas Hubbard , a deputy assistant secretary of state , was part of the US team that reached the agreement on nuclear non-proliferation with North Korea in October .
37 37-64 65 1.0 false He was sent on his new mission after North Korean diplomats at the UN had suggested that this would 'facilitate a resolution ' of the problem .
37 37-65 66 1.0 false But broadcasts and statements from Pyongyang over the last 48 hours have alleged that the helicopter was on a spying mission and have demanded that the US admit as much .
37 37-66 67 1.0 false US officials have maintained that it strayed into North Korea while on routine training because of a navigational error .
37 37-67 68 1.0 false Even so , the US has apologised for the violation of the North 's air space .
37 37-68 69 1.0 false Mr Lee Hamilton , outgoing chairman of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee , warned yesterday that Congress might delay a scheduled US oil shipment to Pyongyang so as to force the release of the pilot .
37 37-69 70 1.0 false The US is to provide 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil , valued at about Dollars 4.7m -LRB- Pounds 3m -RRB- , to North Korea by January 21 as part of the October accord .
37 37-70 71 1.0 false However , the US is anxious not to jeopardise the hard-won agreement which appeared to remove the immediate threat of the North acquiring an offensive nuclear capability .

39 39-0 1 1.0 true He said the troops and guards had been placed under a single , unified command under the overall supervision of General Colin Powell , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
39 39-1 2 1.0 true If General Colin Powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and Gulf war hero , ran with Mr Bush it might be easy to argue that ditching Mr Quayle was not an act of desperation .
39 39-2 3 1.0 true In the US , General Colin Powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , added his voice to the US administration 's criticism of the expulsions .
39 39-3 4 1.0 true GENERAL Colin Powell confirmed yesterday he was thinking of retiring early as chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff , but flatly denied this was because of disagreements with the Clinton administration .

42 42-6 7 1.0 true Interest rate hopes foundered on M3 growth of 10.2 per cent in October against 9.3 per cent in September and a Bundesbank target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent for 1992 .
42 42-7 8 1.0 true Last year M3 grew at 9.4 per cent compared to a target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent , the worst performance since targeting was introduced 18 years before .
42 42-8 9 1.0 false This was still significantly above the 1992 target growth rate of between 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent .
42 42-9 10 1.0 false The bank set a target of 3.5 - 5.5 per cent for the year , but concedes this target can not be met .
42 42-10 11 1.0 false The Bundesbank announced that German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 8.5 per cent in February after a 9.0 per cent rise in January .
42 42-11 12 1.0 false NEWS of higher than expected German monetary growth led to early strength in the D -Mark and a slightly weaker dollar yesterday , writes Peter John .
42 42-12 13 1.0 false The market had been hoping that Germany 's M3 , the measure of money that includes cash savings and long-term deposits of up to four years , would show an annualised growth of around 8.5 per cent .
42 42-13 14 1.0 false 'They are also keeping an eye on the level of unemployment and the relatively slow industrial production growth and it seems likely that there will be a cut , just later than anticipated . '
42 42-14 15 1.0 false At yesterday morning 's repurchase tender , the minimum accepted rate fell to 14.15 per cent , down 65 basis points from the highs it touched last week as fears of a devaluation swept the market .
42 42-15 16 1.0 false German M3 money supply growth is unlikely to have slowed significantly last month .
42 42-16 17 1.0 false In April the year-on-year rate of growth dropped to 8.8 per cent from 9.4 per cent in March .
42 42-17 18 1.0 false Economists are forecasting an annual rate of inflation of 4.3 per cent in May , from a revised 4.6 per cent in April .
42 42-18 19 1.0 false In the first four months of the year they accelerated to an annual rate of 5.7 per cent following rent increases .
42 42-19 20 1.0 false Too great an easing of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve may yet turn a sluggish recovery into rapid growth and accelerating inflation .
42 42-20 21 1.0 false But policy is doubly difficult to judge at present because of the erratic behaviour of the central bankers ' favoured leading indicators of future inflation : the growth of broad monetary aggregates .
42 42-21 22 1.0 false Yet broad money growth may be misleadingly depressed .
42 42-22 23 1.0 false Stripping out small time deposits and money market mutual funds from M2 raises its growth rate to M1 proportions , as the left-hand charts shows .
42 42-23 24 1.0 false While M1 growth remains at historically high levels , the growth of its favoured money supply average - M2 plus certificates of deposit - has collapsed .
42 42-24 25 1.0 false The BOJ , anxious to resist another interest rate cut , argues that this slowdown results from shift of savings into Postal Saving deposits which are excluded from broad money .
42 42-25 26 1.0 false But growth of both bank lending and broad liquidity , which includes the postal savings , is also sluggish .
42 42-26 27 1.0 false In Germany , broad money growth rates suggest that inflation , not recession , remains the main threat .
42 42-27 28 1.0 false The year-on-year growth rates have risen sharply in recent months .
42 42-28 29 1.0 false But the peculiar measure of broad money growth rates stressed by the Bundesbank paints a more alarming picture .
42 42-29 30 1.0 false Rapid money growth in December and January meant that the annualised monthly rate was already 8.9 per cent in January .
42 42-30 31 1.0 false It has since remained outside the target range .
42 42-31 32 1.0 false There are a number of reasons why German broad money growth might be artificially inflated .
42 42-32 33 1.0 false Yet the main force propelling M3 growth , according to the Bundesbank , is the volume of bank lending to companies and individuals .
42 42-33 34 1.0 false But M3 growth is not expected to fall within the Bundesbank 's target range in 1992 .
42 42-34 35 1.0 false This table shows growth rates for the most widely followed measures of narrow and broad money , a representative short- and long-term interest rate series and an average equity market yield .
42 42-35 36 1.0 false Narrow Broad Short Long Equity Money Money Interest Interest Market
42 42-36 37 1.0 false All growth rates refer to the seasonally adjusted series except for Japan and Italy .
42 42-37 38 1.0 false However , while M3 clearly has grown much faster than the German central bank would like , it is not so evident why .
42 42-38 39 1.0 false In March , the growth rate was an annual 9.4 per cent after 8.6 per cent in February and 8.9 per cent in January .
42 42-39 40 1.0 false The rate is expected to slow , but there is little likelihood the Bundesbank will meet its target .
42 42-40 41 1.0 false Nevertheless , the Bundesbank does not intend to make the target range higher simply to make it easier to reach .
42 42-41 42 1.0 false Its goal for M3 -LRB- comprising mainly cash , savings , and short-term deposits -RRB- is a firm expression of its intent to maintain stability .
42 42-42 43 1.0 false Why is the target not being met now ?
42 42-43 44 1.0 false Each year , the Bundesbank assesses Germany 's potential for economic growth and adds a few percentage points for expected inflation and the rate of monetary circulation .
42 42-44 45 1.0 false The result is the M3 goal , with the range representing acceptable upper and lower variations .
42 42-45 46 1.0 false The bank 's determination to stick to its target range is its counter-strategy to the high , and inflationary , state spending and borrowing wave embarked on to support the east German economy .
42 42-46 47 1.0 false Thus , credit demand from the private sector , up at an annual rate of 12 per cent in the past six months , is less subject to the Bundesbank 's control .
42 42-47 48 1.0 false All this points to the question of how seriously M3 's growth should be taken .
42 42-48 49 1.0 false Now , Germany 's Lombard rate is at 9.75 per cent and the discount rate at 8 per cent .
42 42-49 50 1.0 false Inflation has moderated to an annual rate of 4.5 per cent in March , but the Bundesbank is obviously unhappy about wage trends and the vigour of M3 .
42 42-50 51 1.0 false Of immediate concern is the impact of monetary growth on inflation , which the bank wants to see below 4 per cent this year and around 2 per cent later .
42 42-51 52 1.0 false In the 1970s , the average rise in the money supply outpaced real potential growth in the economy by more than 6.5 per cent .
42 42-52 53 1.0 false In the 1980s , M3 grew less rapidly and so did prices .
42 42-53 54 1.0 false 'Prices have tended to follow the growth of the money stock with a lag of about two to three years , ' the bank said .
42 42-54 55 1.0 false Growth in M3 , the target measure of money supply , in France is expected to have risen further in March following February 's increase .
42 42-55 56 1.0 false In February M3 was 3.5 per cent up on a year ago and the median forecast for March is a rise of 0.5 per cent .
42 42-56 57 1.0 false Holland , April consumer prices index -LRB- up 0.3 per cent on month , up 4.3 per cent on year -RRB- ; France , March M3 -LRB- up 0.5 per cent -RRB- .
42 42-57 58 1.0 false Almost every member country of the European exchange rate mechanism will choose to grit its teeth and bear the pain , while the dynamic of European politics will require the UK government to follow suit .
42 42-58 59 1.0 false If the Bundesbank is serious about meeting this target range , then it will almost certainly have to raise the European interest rate floor sometime in the next few months .
42 42-59 60 1.0 false With the money supply growing well beyond the target for 1992 , the Bundesbank 's credibility is clearly at stake - both in the financial community and among Germany 's stability-conscious citizens .
42 42-60 61 1.0 false Nor does the Bonn government , struggling to put its finances in order under the weight of the high cost of unification , want to see the German economy hit by another interest rate blast .
42 42-61 62 1.0 false So he and others reckon a further half-point rise in the discount rate to 8.5 per cent is most likely .
42 42-62 63 1.0 false This would narrow the gap with the more important Lombard rate -LRB- now 9.75 per cent -RRB- , which would be left alone .
42 42-63 64 1.0 false 'Most attention is focused on the discount rate or access to Lombard credits . '
42 42-64 65 1.0 false Moreover , M3 has been swollen by large holdings of the D -Mark in eastern Europe .
42 42-65 66 1.0 false It is unlikely that the target will be changed .
42 42-66 67 1.0 false So the real concentration is on ensuring the right conditions for slower M3 growth in 1993 .
42 42-67 68 1.0 false 'It would be best if they sit on their hands , bite their lips , and say they will wait until M3 comes down , ' says Mr Nigel Rendell , economist with stockbrokers James Capel in London .
42 42-68 69 1.0 false 'You can forget M3 and so forth if a situation like last week continues .
42 42-69 70 1.0 false Not that M3 , the broad monetary aggregate , has been forgotten .
42 42-70 71 1.0 false per cent target range and inflated by the pressures of unification , has been a main reason for Germany 's high interest rates .
42 42-71 72 1.0 false Yesterday , Mr Schlesinger said M3 growth may have eased slightly from the 8.5 per cent annualised rate of July , but the target would not be achieved in 1992 .
42 42-72 73 1.0 false 'It is the money market rate which defines the problem on the foreign exchange market , not the Lombard rate ' .
42 42-73 74 1.0 false His deputy , Mr Hans Tietmeyer , said the rate cuts were not made under pressure from EC partners .
42 42-74 75 1.0 false Last week economists forecast that an annualised expansion rate of more than 10 per cent could be recorded for M3 this month because of the liquidity created by unprecedented D -Mark central bank sales throughout Europe in recent weeks .
42 42-75 76 1.0 false The Bundesbank cut interest rates two weeks ago as part of the lira devaluation package in the European exchange rate mechanism -LRB- ERM -RRB- .
42 42-76 77 1.0 false But many German economists reckon it will now keep the Lombard rate at 9.5 per cent and the discount rate at 8.25 per cent .
42 42-77 78 1.0 false Now they must live with the targeting of D -Mark M3 , instead .
42 42-78 79 1.0 false The question is whether many will come to condemn the Bundesbank 's present targetry , as they do the targeting of sterling M3 in the early 1980s .
42 42-79 80 1.0 false The Bundesbank argues that its attachment to D -Mark M3 reflects the solid empirical relationship between monetary expansion and inflation some three years later .
42 42-80 81 1.0 false The growth rate of D -Mark M3 is slipping back , but too slowly .
42 42-81 82 1.0 false The principal motor of M3 expansion is credit expansion , most of it medium and long term .
42 42-82 83 1.0 false In the last six months , complains the Bundesbank , the annual rate of credit expansion to the private sector was 11 per cent .
42 42-83 84 1.0 false The American authorities can , if they , wish , ignore the exchange rate slide .
42 42-84 85 1.0 false THE BUNDESBANK has fuelled expectations of a further cut in interest rates by softening the emphasis it places on one of its key indicators in the growth of money supply .
42 42-85 86 1.0 false They follow a rising tide of criticism from German economists at the bank 's excessively rigid adherence to the M3 measure of money supply on the ground that it has been distorted by the processes of unification .
42 42-86 87 1.0 false Mr Tietmeyer said that the Bundesbank was 'very conscious that the discussion about the measurement of the growth in money supply is influenced by some special considerations .
42 42-87 88 1.0 false The bund market had expected the money supply target range to be raised .
42 42-88 89 1.0 false Mr Otmar Issing , Bundesbank board member , said German M3 money supply growth slowed in November , and was quoted as saying it would be below 10 per cent .
42 42-89 90 1.0 false The provisional figure of 10.2 per cent for annualised growth for October was revised to 10.3 per cent .
42 42-90 91 1.0 false The decision by Norway to sever the Norwegian krone 's link to the Ecu yesterday put pressure on the weaker members of the European exchange rate mechanism .
42 42-91 92 1.0 false French M3 money supply grew by 0.2 per cent in October , giving year-on-year growth of 5.7 per cent - compared with 5.3 per cent in September .
42 42-92 93 1.0 false Dealers said bunds opened on a relatively firm note following Sunday 's Swiss referendum vote , which rejected a plan for a European Economic Area and led to some uncertainty about tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism .
42 42-93 94 1.0 false Japanese government bonds ended slightly firmer , helped by lower money market rates and hopes of a cut in the Official Discount Rate .
42 42-94 95 1.0 false The unsecured overnight call money rate slipped 1/32 to 3 27/32 per cent yesterday , and dealers are waiting to see whether some of the commercial banks will follow Sanwa Bank 's example and cut their short-term prime rates .
42 42-95 96 1.0 false The Bundesbank has revised the annualised M3 money supply growth rate for September upwards to 9.3 per cent from 9.1 per cent , Reuter reported from Frankfurt yesterday .
42 42-96 97 1.0 false M3 rose by an annualised 8.8 per cent in August .
42 42-97 98 1.0 false Economists had expected the rate of growth in M3 to fall significantly from December .
42 42-98 99 1.0 false The Bundesbank 's currency market interventions helped send annualised M3 growth to a record 10.3 per cent last October .
42 42-99 100 1.0 false Another reason was purely statistical - the Bundesbank calculates the growth with reference to the previous three month 's figures .
42 42-100 101 1.0 false As these were exceptionally high , it was inevitable that the January annualised figure would be vastly improved on the December M3 number .
42 42-101 102 1.0 false Economists were , however , expecting growth of around 4 per cent , not a fall .
42 42-102 103 1.0 false Despite the Bundesbank 's attempts to play down the significance of the number , economists were encouraged , predicting that the Bundesbank would be able to meet its growth target for M3 this year .
42 42-103 104 1.0 false The target was subsequently raised to 4.5 to 6.5 per cent for 1993 .
42 42-104 105 1.0 false The Bundesbank said that on a straightforward year-on-year basis , M3 - which includes cash , current accounts and short-term deposits - grew by 7.5 per cent .
42 42-105 106 1.0 false Norway 's central bank cut the key overnight lending rate to its lowest level since the rate was introduced in 1986 .
42 42-106 107 1.0 false The central bank also lowered the rate for overnight deposits , the credit rate , to 8.25 per cent from 8.50 per cent .
42 42-107 108 1.0 false The key rate reached 25 per cent last November during turbulence in the Scandinavian currency markets .
43 43-0 1 1.0 true Michael Jackson 's beaded , spangled stage clothes are Whitten creations .
43 43-1 2 1.0 false Talking about the Grammys disturbs Bill Whitten .
43 43-2 3 1.0 false `` I 'm just as much a part of the music industry as Michael Jackson , '' Whitten said .
43 43-3 4 1.0 false Whitten 's name is rarely recognized outside the music business , yet his clothing designs are known the world over .
43 43-4 5 1.0 false With each moon-walking step and hand gesture , Michael Jackson displayed the Whitten style .
43 43-5 6 1.0 false `` It was very simple , '' Whitten calmly explained .
43 43-6 7 1.0 false Whitten dressed Elton John in extravagant capes and electric boots .
43 43-7 8 1.0 false Neil Diamond was the first performer to find Whitten , back in 1974 .
43 43-8 9 1.0 false Whitten had opened a custom shirt business called Workroom 27 .
43 43-9 10 1.0 false It was n't long before Diamond became an advocate of Whitten 's custom-designed clothes , and he spread the word .
43 43-10 11 1.0 false When it did , Whitten went from leasing one room to buying the entire building .
43 43-11 12 1.0 false Whitten 's business crested as more and more bands demanded a personalized stage style .
43 43-12 13 1.0 false The store , called Bill Whitten , is scheduled to open March 4 and will carry everything from pajamas to evening wear for men and women .
43 43-13 14 1.0 false Whitten sews metal sequins on 150-year-old , hand-loomed fabric from the Far East to make jackets .
43 43-14 15 1.0 false Whitten 's most inventive decorations appear on tuxedos .
43 43-15 16 1.0 false But Whitten says the drums of the underground beat louder in West Los Angeles than they do in Beverly Hills .
43 43-16 17 1.0 false If other cities want a Bill Whitten store , he 's only too happy to oblige .
43 43-17 18 1.0 false But , there is no Grammy award for the category of costume design .
43 43-18 19 1.0 false Today he regularly suits up Michael Jackson , Lionel Richie , his old friend Neil Diamond and others such as magicians Siegfried and Roy .
43 43-19 20 1.0 false Finally , he decided to give into the demand by opening a store on Melrose Avenue .
44 44-0 1 1.0 false Science fiction has long been filled with chilling scenarios of the future in which evil leaders try to engineer a master race of genetically perfect human beings .
44 44-1 2 1.0 false The tools to accomplish such a feat are slowly moving out of the realm of fiction , however , as geneticists around the world struggle to identify and decode all of the genes contained in the human body .
44 44-2 3 1.0 false Scientists at a recent conference on gene mapping frequently pointed out that , once they determine how a human being is made , they will have little control over how their discoveries are used .
44 44-3 4 1.0 false The United States has announced plans to invest more than $ 3 billion over the next 15 years in the National Institutes of Health 's gene-mapping project , making it the largest in the world .
44 44-4 5 1.0 false France also has a well-advanced gene-mapping program .
44 44-5 6 1.0 false The European Community plans to invest $ 20 million over the next two years on a genome project .
44 44-6 7 1.0 false `` It is very clear that the human genome initiative has captured the imagination of the world , '' said Norton Zinder , chairman of the advisory committee to the NIH 's human genome program .
44 44-7 8 1.0 false Researchers expect that once the genome is defined , medical science can apply the findings to the diagnosis and cure of more than 4,000 human diseases known to stem from gene defects .
44 44-8 9 1.0 false In West Germany , the environmentally focused Greens Party is strongly opposed to the genome project , claiming that the research could lead to human eugenic experiments similar to those carried out by the Nazi regime .
44 44-9 10 1.0 false However , scientists note that the regulations imposed by individual countries may be meaningless for a project that is so international in scope .
44 44-10 11 1.0 false Zinder said the NIH group has been approached by several Third World nations interested in sharing research efforts and results .

47 47-0 1 1.0 true Mitsubishi Heavy Industries -LRB- MHI -RRB- , the largest Japanese builder , said 'we were spilling blood a year ago ' , but now 'business is smooth ' .
47 47-1 2 1.0 false MITSUBISHI Heavy Industries yesterday became the latest Japanese company to announce a big cut in its workforce in response to the worsening Japanese economy .
47 47-2 3 1.0 false That is a thing of the past , ' says Mr Tsuda Yoshida , managing director of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries .
47 47-3 4 1.0 false But the long queue of buyers at Japanese yards has just forced even the patriotic Nippon Yusen to turn to Taiwan for a new bulk carrier .
47 47-4 5 1.0 false 'We have n't bought a ship from outside Japan since the end of the Second World War .
47 47-5 6 1.0 false Japanese shipbuilders are generally relieved that the era of savage competition with South Korea is over .
47 47-6 7 1.0 false While Japanese companies insist that supply has been limited by a 24 per cent cut in capacity administered by the transport ministry , modernisation of facilities has allowed the yards to build more ships per dock .
47 47-7 8 1.0 false This company expects pre-tax profits to more than double to Y5bn in the year to March 1991 .
47 47-8 9 1.0 false JAPANESE and South Korean shipbuilders have emerged from the troubled waters of recession aware that the most significant threat to their dominance of the international shipbuilding industry is rivalry between them .
47 47-9 10 1.0 false Government assistance has certainly played an important role in reviving the two industries , but Japanese and Korean companies now control their own destiny , having last year captured about 65 per cent of the world market .
47 47-10 11 1.0 false Japanese builders have a natural advantage because of about 18 new LNG projects likely to produce demand for vessels , 10 have been backed by Japanese energy companies , while South Korean utility companies are funding three .
47 47-11 12 1.0 false The Japanese industry has survived in spite of fears that shipbuilding would be transferred to lower-cost countries such as China , largely by the introduction of labour-saving technology .
47 47-12 13 1.0 false The second advantage for the Japanese companies is that they are essentially rebuilding the fleets of the large Japanese shipping lines .
47 47-13 14 1.0 false These shippers have traditionally placed orders with Japanese builders , without much regard to cost , which is now about 10 per cent higher than Korean or Taiwanese yards .
47 47-14 15 1.0 false Nippon Yusen said Japanese yards had told it they would not be free to handle that type of vessel for two or three years .
47 47-15 16 1.0 false The determination of Japanese companies to limit supply has created opportunities for Korea .
47 47-16 17 1.0 false 'The Japanese can not continue to expand , ' says Mr Cho Choong Hooy , executive vice-president for sales at Hyundai Heavy Industries , Korea 's largest builder .
47 47-17 18 1.0 false The effects of improved labour relations are clearly visible on the company 's accounts .
47 47-18 19 1.0 false This has removed a traditional advantage for the very punctual Japanese yards and reduces the threat of competition from Chinese yards which have also earned a reputation for tardiness .
47 47-19 20 1.0 false Japanese and Korean builders expect longer-term but limited competition from China and some competition in LNG carrier construction from French builders , which had dominated the sector two decades ago .
47 47-20 21 1.0 false Having established themselves as the world 's second largest shipbuilders , the Korean yards now have become less aggressive competitors .
47 47-21 22 1.0 false Japanese executives say that Korean companies now understand the importance of 'harmony ' in the industry - the implication is that the deep discounting of the past is over .
47 47-22 23 1.0 false 'It used to be that the Koreans would ask you what your best price had been from the Japanese and then they would just offer you 10 per cent less ' , said one foreign shipping executive in Seoul .
47 47-23 24 1.0 false Last autumn , the company sent a number of employees working at its machine-tool plants temporarily to Mitsubishi Motors , a fellow member of the group .
47 47-24 25 1.0 false The downturn has not yet led to huge redundancies , but Japanese companies have been encouraging older employees to retire early , transferring staff to affiliated companies and restricting the intake of graduates .
47 47-25 26 1.0 false The yen 's rise has made Japanese shipbuilding costs 30 per cent higher than South Korea 's .
47 47-26 27 1.0 false An independent company might have been forced to dump the project .
48 48-0 1 1.0 true The massive nuclear complex is located in Yongbyun , 90 km north of Pyongyang .
48 48-1 2 1.0 false However , North Koreans are enriching these materials and producing high-grade uranium and plutonium by using centrifugal separators , which the former Soviet Union gave to North Korea , at an underground nuclear reprocessing plant in Yongbyun .
48 48-2 3 1.0 false The IAEA has said the two facilities , located in a nuclear complex in Yongbyon north of Pyongyang , might yield evidence of how much plutonium North Korea has produced in the past .
48 48-3 4 1.0 false They have expressed concern that missing plutonium from the Yongbyon nuclear reactors might have been diverted to produce nuclear bombs .
48 48-4 5 1.0 false Despite Tuesday 's agreement , the question of inspecting two unreported nuclear sites in the Yongbyon nuclear complex is still pending , presumably for the two sides to discuss later .
48 48-5 6 1.0 false Inspections of the six declared facilities in the Yongbyon nuclear complex , some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang , and one site at Kim Il -song University in the North Korean capital are expected to get under way Wednesday .
48 48-6 7 1.0 false A senior North Korean official admitted that his country possesses plutonium for research purposes at a radiochemical laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear complex , ITAR-TASS News Agency reported from Pyongyang on Monday .
48 48-7 8 1.0 false The basic purpose of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor , constructed through close cooperation with Russia , is to secure the nuclear power generation necessary to develop the country 's economy , he asserted .
48 48-8 9 1.0 false The information received from Yongbyon thus far is that the inspection team has not encountered any problems , they added .
48 48-9 10 1.0 false Construction of the Yongbyon nuclear development complex began in 1962 .
48 48-10 11 1.0 false Security is so tight that even Kim Il -song has to disembark from his car when entering the Yongbyon complex .
48 48-11 12 1.0 false Subsequently , the `` Korea - USSR Agreement on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy `` was signed in 1959 , and North Korea began creating a nuclear development complex in Yongbyon in 1962 .
48 48-12 13 1.0 false It is officially unknown who was the first director of the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center -LSB- NRC -RSB- .
48 48-13 14 1.0 false According to a scientist who was deeply involved in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort , `` Yi Sung -ki was the first director `` of the Yongbyon NRC .
48 48-14 15 1.0 false According to Mr. `` B , '' the person who said that Yi Sung-ki did not take part in the North Korean nuclear development program , `` the first director of the Yongbyon NRC was Han In -sok . ''
48 48-15 16 1.0 false Following his return home , he served as the second director of the Yongbyon NRC , then as minister of the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry , which was created within the State Administration Ministry in December 1986 .
48 48-16 17 1.0 false Suppose North Korea had spent about 4 years making such preparations , the 5-megawatt -class Yongbyon No. 2 atomic reactor was possibly built in early 1980 .
48 48-17 18 1.0 false On his return from Moscow , he served as a professor at Pyongsong Institute of Science before moving to the Yongbyon NRC .
48 48-18 19 1.0 false Once , there were moves among students to avoid taking the course as those who willingly had entered the course first saw graduates assigned to Yongbyon or military-related research institutes .
48 48-19 20 1.0 false Other major research institutes are mostly lactated in the Yongbyon complex .
48 48-20 21 1.0 false The Yongbyon nuclear complex was created in the late 1950 's .
48 48-21 22 1.0 false Yongbyon is geographically very close to Pakchon .
48 48-22 23 1.0 false Yongbyon was gradually turned into a secret town .
48 48-23 24 1.0 false On this point , Mr. `` A `` said : `` There is a check point at the Kuryong River bridge leading to the Yongbyon complex .
48 48-24 25 1.0 false In addition , it is known that there are many underground plants in Taechon , only eight km from Yongbyon , he added .
48 48-25 26 1.0 false North Korea reiterated Monday that two alleged nuclear facilities at Yongbyon are military sites and the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- has no right to inspect them .
48 48-26 27 1.0 false He said the mere presence of IAEA inspectors at the Yongbyon nuclear complex when North Korea changes nuclear fuel rods at the 5- megawatt reactor is insufficient .
48 48-27 28 1.0 false The IAEA had given a deadline of March 25 for the government of Mr Kim Il -sung , a communist dictator , to permit inspections of two storage buildings at Yongbyon , North Korea 's nuclear complex .
48 48-28 29 1.0 false IAEA inspectors yesterday completed maintenance work on monitoring equipment installed at North Korea 's Yongbyon nuclear complex .
48 48-29 30 1.0 false The IAEA is likely to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council today after Pyongyang last week blocked inspection tests by the agency at the Yongbyon nuclear complex .
48 48-30 31 1.0 false The international community has suspected North Korea of developing nuclear weapons and I recently obtained a document decisively proving that it already possesses nuclear weapons .
48 48-31 32 1.0 false The document is a formal report compiled by the Russian Government which long helped North Korea develop nuclear technology .
48 48-32 33 1.0 false What draws our attention in the report is North Korea 's nuclear development .
48 48-33 34 1.0 false It devotes five pages out of 36 to North Korea 's nuclear development .
48 48-34 35 1.0 false The report gives a general picture of North Korea 's nuclear development .
48 48-35 36 1.0 false It says : `` The Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LSB- DARK -RSB- has announced its decision to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- and the DPRK has test-fired medium-range ballistic missiles .
48 48-36 37 1.0 false It has also refused to allow nuclear inspections by the committee of the international atomic organization -LSB- name as received -RSB- .
48 48-37 38 1.0 false The report also indicates that North Korea 's threat to the security of Russia , the United States , and Japan is drastically growing .
48 48-38 39 1.0 false The section was written about North Korea 's nuclear development for senior officers of the General Staff of the Armed Forces and Russian Government leaders .
48 48-39 40 1.0 false The section entitled `` Technology Information `` says : Now , nine people with Russian citizenship are working as nuclear physicists in North Korea .
48 48-40 41 1.0 false Soviet experts were most active in North Korea in the later half of the 1980 's .
48 48-41 42 1.0 false At that time , North Korea was engaged in developing Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missile with direct assistance of the Soviet Union .
48 48-42 43 1.0 false The missile flies at the maximum speed of more than Mach nine and tipping the missile with nuclear warheads is in the final stage .
48 48-43 44 1.0 false At the same time , North Korea is developing Nodong -2 .
48 48-44 45 1.0 false The major task for North Korea is to improve the performance of the Nodong-2 -- extension of range and miniaturization of warheads .
48 48-45 46 1.0 false According to the report , North Korea now has 10-12 kg of uranium-235 and 20 kg of plutonium -239 .
48 48-46 47 1.0 false According to Russian nuclear experts , they are enough to manufacture three to five nuclear warheads .
48 48-47 48 1.0 false The Soviet Union provided North Korea with a centrifugal separator which is capable of greatly increasing the effect of enriched uranium .
48 48-48 49 1.0 false The report describes North Korea 's suspected nuclear development as in the `` final stage '' which has attracted attention of the American and European journalists and the world .
48 48-49 50 1.0 false In an interview with me , a senior officer with the Military Strategy Research Center under the General Staff of the Armed Forces , which compiled the report , gave details of North Korea 's nuclear development .
48 48-50 51 1.0 false In the interview , he revealed not only the existence of nuclear arms in North Korea , but fearful facts .
48 48-51 52 1.0 false The following are questions and answers : Unidentified officer : `` In my view , nuclear inspections are a ridiculous story .
48 48-52 53 1.0 false North Korea has already completed the development of Hiroshima -type atomic bomb and it is widely known among us that North Korea has at least one atomic bomb .
48 48-53 54 1.0 false The North Koreans are using Russian scientists to promote the manufacturing of a few atomic bombs according to the ` Nuclear Development Project ' which they have worked out on their own .
48 48-54 55 1.0 false In the past , the Soviet Union provided North Korea with uranium mining knowhow and technicians as well .
48 48-55 56 1.0 false The Soviet Union did all that for smooth promotion of nuclear development in North Korea .
48 48-56 57 1.0 false Because of the help from the Soviet Union , the north now has 20 kilograms of plutonium .
48 48-57 58 1.0 false Roughly speaking , it is possible to make one nuclear warhead if you have eight kilograms of plutonium .
48 48-58 59 1.0 false Kato : But , Russia is officially saying it is not supporting North Korean nuclear development .
48 48-59 60 1.0 false As is written in the report , Russian technicians are engaged in North Korean nuclear development .
48 48-60 61 1.0 false The total number of Russian technicians , who were sent to North Korea , was well over 100 .
48 48-61 62 1.0 false They are staying there and obtaining North Korean citizenship and changing their names .
48 48-62 63 1.0 false However , judging from this fact , there is no doubt that North Korea is steadily perfecting its missile development . ''
48 48-63 64 1.0 false `` Currently , North Korea has three different kinds of missiles , which are capable of carrying nuclear warheads .
48 48-64 65 1.0 false They are Scud-A , B and C types which were manufactured in the north under a production license , and they have 300 such missiles in all .
48 48-65 66 1.0 false However , what we should pay attention to is the Nodong-2 , which North Korea is developing as a weapon to replace Nodong -1 .
48 48-66 67 1.0 false Why does North Korea need an ICBM ?
48 48-67 68 1.0 false That is because Kim Il -song and Kim Chong-il saw Tomahawk 's attack the Iraqi military with pinpoint accuracy during the war and clearly realized that North Korea will immediately suffer crushing blows once it engages in a war .
48 48-68 69 1.0 false Kato : Does that mean the Gulf war made North Korea change its missile development plan ?
48 48-69 70 1.0 false Previously , North Korea was using a liquid fuel method for all of its missile development .
48 48-70 71 1.0 false Whatever the case may be , North Korea 's demands concerning ICBM development technology are persistent and urgent . ''
48 48-71 72 1.0 false Whatever the case may be , North Korea 's demand concerning ICBM development technology is persistent and urgent . ''
48 48-72 73 1.0 false If what the senior officer said is true , not only Japan but also all other nations will be exposed to the nuclear threat of Kim Il - song .
48 48-73 74 1.0 false In fact , reportedly , the United States and Russia , fearing North Korea 's suspected nuclear development , have already started preparing for the North Korean threat .
48 48-74 75 1.0 false Actually , the senior officer said the report described above has been written on the assumption that the world will be exposed to North Korea 's nuclear threat .
48 48-75 76 1.0 false As he said , the report emphasizes that Japan , the United States , and Russia should jointly cope with the North Korean threat .
48 48-76 77 1.0 false The following are the major points of the report : 1 -RRB- Within the Russian military authorities , there are some groups cooperating with North Korea in nuclear development .
48 48-77 78 1.0 false 3 -RRB- Should the military authorities cooperate with North Korea , it would double Japan 's and South Korea 's distrust of Russia .
48 48-78 79 1.0 false Therefore , in view of ensuring security , it is extremely dangerous to cooperate with North Korea .
48 48-79 80 1.0 false Therefore , it is absurd to cooperate with North Korea in nuclear development .
48 48-80 81 1.0 false `` Particularly , they have agreed that it is necessary to urgently come up with measures to deal with ICBM missiles which North Korea is developing secretly .
48 48-81 82 1.0 false However , in fact , at the meeting , in-depth discussions were held on such topics as progress in North Korea 's nuclear development , and its strike capability .
48 48-82 83 1.0 false When the meeting is held , Russia will bring a more detailed , precise report on North Korea 's military power .
48 48-83 84 1.0 false It is also true that after Prime Minister Hosokawa 's visit to the United States for the summit meeting , Japanese ministries and agencies concerned with North Korean issues have started seriously studying possible economic sanctions against North Korea .
48 48-84 85 1.0 false I think it is time for the Japanese Government to tell the people about how nuclear bombs and missiles are being developed by North Korea because the North Korean issue directly affects the future security of Japan .
48 48-85 86 1.0 false The senior officer also said : `` Russia is not the only country which provides North Korea with nuclear resources .
48 48-86 87 1.0 false You probably do not know that China has been cooperating with North Korea .
48 48-87 88 1.0 false It has been confirmed that a great volume of uranium has been brought in to North Korea only recently .
48 48-88 89 1.0 false If so , nuclear material brought in to North Korea must be low-level radioactive material .
48 48-89 90 1.0 false However , if it is so inclined , North Korea can collect nuclear development and materials know-how .
48 48-90 91 1.0 false `` What you should not forget is the fact that North Korea already has at least one atomic bomb and 1 , 000-kilometer range missiles . ''
48 48-91 92 1.0 false Addressing a news conference at the Japan National Press Club , Hashimoto said , `` there are still some murky points , as North Korea has not agreed to accept inspection of its two nuclear waste reprocessing facilities . ''
48 48-92 93 1.0 false Hashimoto 's comment came a day after North Korea told the IAEA it will allow IAEA monitors to inspect the seven nuclear sites , while keeping out them out of the two critical facilities .
48 48-93 94 1.0 false `` The LDP 's own study indicates that the Hosokawa administration has not compiled any crisis management program '' to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue , he said .
48 48-94 95 1.0 false Hashimoto said the LDP `` will not consider exchanges `` between party officials and the North Korean Government following the 1993 fall from grace of former LDP Vice President Shin Kanemaru who had kept ties with the Pyongyang authorities .
48 48-95 96 1.0 false `` Although it is true that Mr. Kanemaru held talks with the North Korean Government , he did so as a mere individual , '' he said .
48 48-96 97 1.0 false He said the LDP had never sought to build ties with the North Korean leadership as a party policy .
48 48-97 98 1.0 false Their talks with North Korean leader Kim Il -song later led to the start of diplomatic normalization talks between the two countries .
48 48-98 99 1.0 false The normalization talks broke down after Pyongyang refused to comply with the IAEA 's demands to inspect its nuclear facilities .
48 48-99 100 1.0 false North Korea has agreed to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- to conduct inspection on all seven reported nuclear facilities , the IAEA announced Tuesday .
48 48-100 101 1.0 false At a working-level contact in Vienna Tuesday , North Korea informed the IAEA that it will accept all IAEA conditions for inspection , the announcement said .
48 48-101 102 1.0 false Meanwhile in New York , North Korea and the United States resumed their working-level meeting Tuesday to negotiate followup measures on IAEA inspection .
48 48-102 103 1.0 false At the Vienna meeting , the IAEA told North Korea it plans to send a team of inspectors as soon as possible .
48 48-103 104 1.0 false The IAEA said the purpose of the upcoming inspection is to see whether the nuclear materials in the seven reported facilities had been converted for other uses since February last year when the IAEA last conducted inspection .
48 48-104 105 1.0 false The main point of the agreement was North Korea 's acceptance of all the conditions the IAEA had laid out for the forthcoming inspection , IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said .
48 48-105 106 1.0 false Meyer also explained that the agreement does not mean that there was a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue .
48 48-106 107 1.0 false The inspection team , comprising six to seven experts , is expected to stay in North Korea for two to three weeks , IAEA officials said .
48 48-107 108 1.0 false Councilor Yun Ho -chin of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna said that the agreement was reached in order to maintain continuity in nuclear safeguards .
48 48-108 109 1.0 false In another development , North Korea is reportedly sending a high-level delegation to the IAEA board meeting Feb. 21 .
48 48-109 110 1.0 false The IAEA- North Korean agreement came after six rounds of talks since Pyongyang and Washington reached an accord in New York on Jan. 7 .
48 48-110 111 1.0 false A seven -member inspection team arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday to resume inspections of North Korea 's seven declared nuclear facilities after a lapse of more than a year , informed sources in Beijing said .
48 48-111 112 1.0 false North Korea agreed to the inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- on Friday in New York at a working-level meeting with U.S. Officials .
48 48-112 113 1.0 false The inspections , however , will not include the two undeclared sites suspected of being nuclear waste storage facilities that could reveal the nature of the North Korean nuclear program .
48 48-113 114 1.0 false IAEA inspectors have said that to make the checks meaningful they would have to examine the nuclear fuel rods to determine if plutonium , which could be used in the manufacture of an atomic arsenal , had been extracted .
48 48-114 115 1.0 false Meanwhile , Pyongyang rejected a South Korean request on Tuesday to reopen the inter- Korean dialogue , proposing instead to meet Thursday at the border truce village of Panmunjom .
48 48-115 116 1.0 false In response to the delay , the South Korean Government held off its decision to cancel the `` Team Spirit `` U.S. - South Korea joint military exercises .
48 48-116 117 1.0 false Reopening the inter- Korean dialogue and calling off the military exercises had been half of a four -item agreement reached February 25 in a working-level meeting in New York between U.S. and North Korean representatives .
48 48-117 118 1.0 false The agreement had been reached to ensure IAEA inspectors access to the North Korean facilities .
48 48-118 119 1.0 false North and South have agreed to make the Korean peninsula nuclear- free , but North Korea has insisted that the issue can only be resolved through a bilateral dialogue with Washington .
48 48-119 120 1.0 false It says : `` The Democratic People 's Republic of Korea -LSB- DPRK -RSB- has announced its decision to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- and the DPRK has test-fired medium-range ballistic missiles .
48 48-120 121 1.0 false At that time , North Korea was engaged in developing Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missile with the direct assistance of the Soviet Union .
48 48-121 122 1.0 false The following are questions and answers : -LSB- Unidentified officer -RSB- `` In my view , nuclear inspections are a ridiculous story .
48 48-122 123 1.0 false -LSB- Kato -RSB- But , Russia is officially saying it is not supporting North Korean nuclear development .
48 48-123 124 1.0 false -LSB- Kato -RSB- Does that mean the Gulf war made North Korea change its missile development plan ?
48 48-124 125 1.0 false If what the senior officer said is true , not only Japan but also all other nations will be exposed to the nuclear threat of Kim Il -song .
48 48-125 126 1.0 false Choe is the first top North Korean official to admit to his country 's possession of plutonium .
48 48-126 127 1.0 false Although the former Soviet Union provided key assistance in building the reactor , he continued , North Korea does not hold out much hope that its successor Russia will do the same .
48 48-127 128 1.0 false He maintained that `` there is almost no cooperation with Russia presently in the nuclear field . ''
48 48-128 129 1.0 false Press reports that North Korea was not attempting to separate the spent nuclear fuel rods and preserve them for later inspection have not been confirmed , sources said .
48 48-129 130 1.0 false The inspectors would surely have raised this issue had North Korea moved the fuel rods elsewhere or handled them in any other way , they said .
48 48-130 131 1.0 false Manpower in North Korea 's Nuclear Development Program : Its Personal Relationships , Training and Taboos
48 48-131 132 1.0 false To Sang-nok , Han In -sok and other scientists who defected to the North against the `` National University Plan `` laid the foundations .
48 48-132 133 1.0 false Theses written by 100 -odd North Korean scientists in the 1970 's are kept in the U.S. National Archives .
48 48-133 134 1.0 false When did North Korea embark on its nuclear development program ?
48 48-134 135 1.0 false These questions surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue have not been fully answered , although there has been a great deal of discussion dealing with hardware .
48 48-135 136 1.0 false For this reporting , I interviewed nuclear scientists in the South , persons who had served in high positions in North Korea in the past , and correspondents who visited Pyongyang .
48 48-136 137 1.0 false Among them were some who were deeply involved in the nuclear development effort in the Pak Chong-hui era .
48 48-137 138 1.0 false North Korea first began exploring nuclear development possibilities in the mid-1950 's immediately after the end of the Korean War .
48 48-138 139 1.0 false The next year , in 1955 , President Eisenhower went so far as to say that `` new-type nuclear weapons '' will be deployed to the U.S. Forces in Korea -LSB- USFK -RSB- , stirring North Korea .
48 48-139 140 1.0 false Meanwhile , President Syngman Rhee , crying out for `` March to the North for Reunification , '' declared that `` if the North invades us , we will respond with a nuclear holocaust . ''
48 48-140 141 1.0 false North Korea , confronted with the crisis , held a mammoth Pyongyang City Mass Rally on 5 August 1955 to condemn the United States .
48 48-141 142 1.0 false According to Mr `` A , '' a former North Korean official who participated in that rally , `` the uneasy feelings the nuclear threat caused among the North Korean authorities and population then were almost a panic . ''
48 48-142 143 1.0 false About that time , the former Soviet Union , then the leading power of the communist world , launched an all-out effort to develop a new-type , nuclear weapon that can match what the United States had .
48 48-143 144 1.0 false Thus came the `` Agreement on the Organization of a Joint Nuclear Research Center `` signed in 1956 as part of Soviet nuclear strategy .
48 48-144 145 1.0 false The joint research thus started was conducted at the renowned Dubna Nuclear Research Center in Moscow .
48 48-145 146 1.0 false It was an old institute reorganized and rechristened `` Dubna Joint Nuclear Research Center , '' they say .
48 48-146 147 1.0 false `` It was then that North Korea , in accordance with the agreement , began sending 20 to 30 nuclear physicists to Dubna every year , '' said Mr `` A. ``
48 48-147 148 1.0 false Through all this , Pyongyang took interest in a nuclear development program early on .
48 48-148 149 1.0 false Then came the 1962 `` Cuban crisis '' which led North Korea to distrust the Soviet nuclear umbrella .
48 48-149 150 1.0 false North Korea was seized with apprehensions that with Khrushchev in power , the protection of the Soviet nuclear umbrella could be taken away from it in the event of a similar U.S. threat .
48 48-150 151 1.0 false It was precisely in December that year at the Fifth Plenum of the Fourth Workers Party of Korea -LSB- WPK -RSB- Central Committee that North Korea put forth the Four Military Lines calling for self-reliant defenses .
48 48-151 152 1.0 false The U.S. nuclear threat increased its pressure on North Korea in the early 1970 's .
48 48-152 153 1.0 false Newspapers and broadcasts unhesitatingly reported on the nuclear arming of the USFK .
48 48-153 154 1.0 false `` At the time , North Korea was engrossed in the task of determining the strength of tactical nuclear weapons deployed to the USFK .
48 48-154 155 1.0 false Materials were gathered from South Korean newspapers , broadcasts , and magazines and from authoritative Japanese and U.S. newspapers for analytical purposes .
48 48-155 156 1.0 false Through this work , it determined that the number of tactical nuclear weapons as referred to in a ` Memorandum of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , ' was 900 to 1,000 , '' said Mr. `` A. ``
48 48-156 157 1.0 false Against these historical backdrops , Kim Il -song and Kim Chong-il began saying in the mid-1970 's that `` the key of modern warfare is nuclear strategy .
48 48-157 158 1.0 false The nuclear weapon can be a political and military threat . ''
48 48-158 159 1.0 false In other words , Pyongyang had recognized its military strategic need for nuclear weapons .
48 48-159 160 1.0 false Further , it began viewing nuclear weapons in light of the strategy for survival .
48 48-160 161 1.0 false It was then that the North Korean leadership began thinking -- vaguely though -- that it should come to have nuclear weapons .
48 48-161 162 1.0 false The father and son are said to have defected to the North together .
48 48-162 163 1.0 false Without Soviet aid , he was laying the foundations of nuclear energy research almost single-handedly .
48 48-163 164 1.0 false In other words , To Sang-nok is the father of nuclear research in North Korea . ''
48 48-164 165 1.0 false To Sang -nok became an Academician , the highest position for a scientist in North Korea , and was awarded the titles of Labor Hero and People 's Scientist .
48 48-165 166 1.0 false Meanwhile , some observers view Dr Yi Sung -ki as having made greater contributions to the North Korea nuclear development program .
48 48-166 167 1.0 false They are mostly veteran scientists who know both To Sang-nok and Yi Sung -ki well or those who took part in the Pak Chong-hui era nuclear development effort .
48 48-167 168 1.0 false He was the second SNU president when he defected to the North immediately before the Korean War .
48 48-168 169 1.0 false He is the top leader of North Korean scientists .
48 48-169 170 1.0 false `` He was not , '' countered Mr. `` B , '' the former North Korean official who testified earlier about To Sang-no .
48 48-170 171 1.0 false He became the director of the Research Institute of Chemical Technology right after his defection to the North , but soon began devoting himself to vinalon research while leaving institute business to Yo Kyong -ku , his junior partner .
48 48-171 172 1.0 false It should be noted , however , that while making all-out efforts for nuclear development , North Korea did even more to develop chemical weapons .
48 48-172 173 1.0 false -LSB- passage omitted -RSB- Meanwhile , influenced by Dr. Yi Sung -ki , many professors and students of the SNU engineering school 's chemical engineering branch defected to the North .
48 48-173 174 1.0 false Among those professors were Yo Kyong -ku , who went over to the North even before Yi , and Ma Hyong-ok , Yi Se-hun , Kim Tae-yol , Yi Chang -chik , and Sin Hyon -sok .
48 48-174 175 1.0 false It is difficult to rule out the possibility of those who had majored in chemical engineering , a course with possible links to nuclear reprocessing , having performed a role in the nuclear development program .
48 48-175 176 1.0 false Besides Dr. Yi Sung -ki and Prof. To Sang-nok , another person who seemed to have played a leading role in the nuclear development program is Prof. Han In -sok .
48 48-176 177 1.0 false In the North , however , it seems that he stood very much in the spotlight .
48 48-177 178 1.0 false He began giving North Korean leaders , including party cadres , lectures on the importance of nuclear energy and the need for nuclear development , in the late 1950 's .
48 48-178 179 1.0 false In the early 1960 's , he put out many theses concerning nuclear development .
48 48-179 180 1.0 false Han In-sok , along with To Sang-nok , can be called the founder of North Korea 's nuclear physics . ''

48 48-183 184 1.0 false About that time , after learning that Dr. Yi Sung -ki was troubled by the `` National University Plan , '' he is said to have visited Yi to suggest that he go over to the North .
48 48-184 185 1.0 false In North Korea , Yo Kyong -ku rose to Candidate Academician of the Academy of Sciences .
48 48-185 186 1.0 false In North Korea , he briefly departed from scientific research and joined a political school , even serving as the party 's top responsible officer at KISU .
48 48-186 187 1.0 false Kim Yong-ho , who majored in quantum chemistry at Japan 's Kyoto U. , was a chemistry professor at Kyongsong U. when he defected to the North .

48 48-192 193 1.0 false Scientists referred to in the above were mostly Kyongsong U. professors in physics or chemical engineering when they defected to the North .
48 48-193 194 1.0 false In the views of atomic energy-related scholars , they must have laid North Korea 's scientific foundations , setting the direction of its nuclear development program .
48 48-194 195 1.0 false These people went straight to North Korea while they were overseas for study purposes .
48 48-195 196 1.0 false In the views of atomic energy scientists in the South , it is possible that they also participated in North Korea 's Big Science project , the nuclear development program .
48 48-196 197 1.0 false Forming another group are second-generation scientists who were trained by the above-listed seniors and who could have performed the central role in the nuclear development program .

48 48-203 204 1.0 false He is a specialist who is , in effect , in charge of external affairs concerning the North Korean nuclear issue .
48 48-204 205 1.0 false Kye Yong-sun , a KISU gradate , who also studied in the Dubna NRC , is a key figure in North Korea 's nuclear power plant construction .
48 48-205 206 1.0 false It was he who first suggested that `` we build nuclear power plants for ourselves '' in early 1970 , they say .
48 48-206 207 1.0 false Kye Hyong -sun , former minister of machine-building industry , regarded as the godfather of North Korea 's munitions industry , is his elder brother , they say .
48 48-207 208 1.0 false Under these second-generation scientists , there are third-generation specialists who returned from the former Soviet Union and are currently active on the first line of the nuclear development program .
48 48-208 209 1.0 false Fortunately , Mr `` B , '' the former high official in North Korea , knew one of them -- Yi Yun- song , alias Yi Yun-su .
48 48-209 210 1.0 false It is by using our judgement on the basis of theses written by North Korean scientists .
48 48-210 211 1.0 false Agencies in the South reportedly used the same method for some time to measure levels of the North Korean nuclear development program .
48 48-211 212 1.0 false The Korean division of the National Archives of the U.S. Congress is known to be the only place in the West that provides access to theses by North Korean scientists .
48 48-212 213 1.0 false Entering the 1970 's , North Korea apparently tightened control over the handling of theses as it embarked on its nuclear development program .
48 48-213 214 1.0 false Most of the theses were printed in KWAHAGWON TONGBO -LSB- ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORT -RSB- , which is a highest-level journal published in North Korea .
48 48-214 215 1.0 false In addition , there were scientists brought in from overseas , mostly Korean residents in foreign countries .
48 48-215 216 1.0 false Explaining , Mr. `` B '' said : `` I understand that quite a few overseas Korean nuclear scientists entered North Korea .
48 48-216 217 1.0 false Of those from Japan , some stayed on in North Korea taking part in the development program while others shuttled between the two countries .
48 48-217 218 1.0 false The Korean Scientists and Engineers Association in Japan -LRB- Kwahyop -RRB- served as the channel .
48 48-218 219 1.0 false Kwahyop 's slogan was `` Promote Scientific Research and Technological Development of Korean Scientists in Japan and Contribute to North Korea 's Construction . ''
48 48-219 220 1.0 false Among them are scientists working in nuclear fusion , control engineering and accelerator fields or even taking part in nuclear technology development programs .
48 48-220 221 1.0 false Dr. Kyong Won - ha is one of them whose name is frequently mentioned in conversations concerning Korean scientists who went to North Korea from Japan .
48 48-221 222 1.0 false He is known to have participated in the atomic bomb building at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico , then served as professor at Canada 's McGill University before moving to North Korea in about 1974 .
48 48-222 223 1.0 false But a check with atomic energy-related scientists and people who formerly serviced in high posts in North Korea revealed that none of them had any knowledge about him .
48 48-223 224 1.0 false North Korea 's training system for nuclear-related talents also deserves careful attention .
48 48-224 225 1.0 false The first nuclear physics course was established in 1949 before the Korean War .
48 48-225 226 1.0 false `` That year , North Korea 's first nuclear physics course was created within the KISU physics school and 30 students were selected for it , '' said Mr `` B. ``
48 48-226 227 1.0 false Needless to say , they were not all nuclear physics students .
48 48-227 228 1.0 false Suppose 30 students left for Moscow or St. Petersburg in any given year , three to four of them were nuclear physics students .
48 48-228 229 1.0 false The KISU nuclear physics course was closed temporarily during the war but reopened later .
48 48-229 230 1.0 false After that , in about 1957 , a nuclear engineering department , made up by three courses , was created in Kim Chaek Institute of Technology -LSB- KCIT -RSB- .
48 48-230 231 1.0 false Further , in 1963 , a nuclear physics course was opened in Pyongsong Institute of Science in South Pyongan Province , a college under the control of the Academy of Sciences , accepting 50 students .
48 48-231 232 1.0 false Pyongsong is a North Korean science town similar to Taedok Science Town in the South , and its Institute of Science is an equivalent of our Institute of Science and Technology .
48 48-232 233 1.0 false While they are all for the study of nuclear physics , KISU is dedicated to both theoretical and technological researches , KCIT trains technical personnel and Pyongsong trains scientists , research officers and professors primarily in fundamental theoretical fields .
48 48-233 234 1.0 false Besides , a nuclear engineering department was created in the National Defense College in Hyesan in about 1963 , primarily for the training of specialists in munitions and weaponry .
48 48-234 235 1.0 false Basically through these four institutes , North Korea has systematically trained its personnel since the 1950 's .
48 48-235 236 1.0 false The length of their nuclear physics courses is 7 years , they say , and they accept only bright students .
48 48-236 237 1.0 false Children of state cadres who are bright enough are required to take the nuclear physics course mandatorily even if it is against their wish .
48 48-237 238 1.0 false Since that time , if a student would avoid applying for the nuclear physics course , he or she would be sent to the countryside or otherwise called to task for it . ''
48 48-238 239 1.0 false Attached to these institutes are , respectively , `` the KISU Nuclear Physics Research Institute , '' `` the KCIT Nuclear Physics Research Institute , '' and `` the Nuclear Physics Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences . ''
48 48-239 240 1.0 false The KISU Nuclear Physics Research Institute has a long history of research in radioactive isotope .
48 48-240 241 1.0 false They include the `` Atomic Energy Research Institute , '' `` Radioactivity Prevention Research Institute , '' and `` Nuclear Power Generating Research Institute . ''
48 48-241 242 1.0 false North Korea began its expansion in earnest in 1962 after the fifth plenum of the fourth party Central Committee .
48 48-242 243 1.0 false Beginning in the 1960 's , North Korean institutes turned out nuclear scientists in large numbers who were trained by themselves through those 7-year courses .
48 48-243 244 1.0 false There they , along with scientists from other socialist nations , jointly participated in the Soviet nuclear development program .
48 48-244 245 1.0 false So , Soviet scientists , knowing about their abilities more than anyone else , would never underestimate the levels of North Korean students , it is said .
48 48-245 246 1.0 false At times , students were deported back home from Dubna because of their persistent attempt to spy on advanced Soviet nuclear technology .
48 48-246 247 1.0 false North Korean students were also sent to the Kurchatov NRC , the Kiev NRC and the Ioffe NRC .
48 48-247 248 1.0 false While Dubna was for basic research in nuclear physics , Kurchatov was known as a laboratory for experimenting and building nuclear bombs .
48 48-248 249 1.0 false Dr. Yi Pyong -hwi happened to be allowed to visit the Kurchatov Nuclear Physics Research Center , a secret facility , for 1 week in 1992 .
48 48-249 250 1.0 false Named after Dr. Kurchatov , who led the team that built and tested the first Soviet nuclear bomb in 1949 , the center stands about 20 kilometers from downtown Moscow .
48 48-250 251 1.0 false Nuclear fusion , remote control and radioactivity lab facilities appeared to be incomparably more sophisticated and advanced than those at the Argonne National Laboratory where the Manhattan Project was conducted .
48 48-251 252 1.0 false Consequently , the United States is reportedly working on economic aid for improvement in the treatment of Russian nuclear scientists so as to prevent their exodus from the country .
48 48-252 253 1.0 false North Korea also sent scientists to China , which successfully conducted its first atomic bomb test in 1964 , although fewer in numbers than those sent to the Soviet Union .
48 48-253 254 1.0 false For exchanges with Chinese nuclear physicists , Pyongyang sent its specialists to Xiangshan Zhao Dai Suo in Beijing where those Chinese frequently get together .
48 48-254 255 1.0 false Thus trained through various routes , the number of North Korean nuclear experts and technical personnel is now estimated at approximately more than 5,000 , including 200 trained at Dubna .
48 48-255 256 1.0 false North Korea produced on its own a short-range rocket missile using nuclear energy in the late 1960 's .
48 48-256 257 1.0 false Pyongyang 's nuclear policy came to the fore in March 1974 when Kim Il -song told a National Industrial Workers Meeting that `` we must build nuclear power plants on our own . ''
48 48-257 258 1.0 false In addition to an army of nuclear talents thus trained , North Korea has uranium ore deposits scattered all over the country , a factor that made possible the nuclear development on its own .
48 48-258 259 1.0 false Other uranium mines include one at Unggi , North Hamgyong Province , and the Kujang Mine in Mt .
48 48-259 260 1.0 false Although North Korea had to send ores to the Soviet Union for processing before the 1960 's , it later built its own smelting plants near mines for independent processing .

48 48-261 262 1.0 false Guard posts were erected around the complex , which was then put off limits to unauthorized persons .
48 48-262 263 1.0 false Officials from the complex in another car meet them there .
48 48-263 264 1.0 false Researchers are usually not authorized to leave the complex .
48 48-264 265 1.0 false Telephones and mail to and from the complex are out of question .
48 48-265 266 1.0 false On the other hand , the complex has every facility needed for the daily life of people there , they say .
48 48-266 267 1.0 false When the need arises for building facilities inside the complex , a special team of the 105th construction unit under the Ministry of Public Security is assigned to it .
48 48-267 268 1.0 false So , there is absolutely no way for outside people to know what is going on inside the complex .
48 48-268 269 1.0 false `` Considering the fact that major North Korean facilities have gone underground , facilities that have been put to the international inspections are only those that had been made public .
48 48-269 270 1.0 false Nuclear physics research institutes attached to universities in general are also under strict security .
48 48-270 271 1.0 false Mr. `` A `` said he would like to point out a misconception which he comes across so frequently in discussions about the North Korean nuclear issue .
48 48-271 272 1.0 false It is that because of the current economic crisis , Pyongyang would be unable to continue the enormously expensive nuclear development program .
48 48-272 273 1.0 false Materials needed for the nuclear development program are mostly available domestically .
48 48-273 274 1.0 false CNN also broadcast an interview with a former Costa Rican president who was visiting Pyongyang , presumably for North Korean President Kim Il -song 's 82nd birthday last Friday .
48 48-274 275 1.0 false `` Inspecting military sites is an issue that has to be dealt with between North and South Korea in the process of disarmament between the two sides , '' Kim said .

48 48-276 277 1.0 false North Korea , as an independent state , has a right to maintain multilateral relations including military cooperation with other countries .
48 48-277 278 1.0 false The International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- has asked North Korean experts to visit Vienna for talks on replacing fuel rods in a nuclear reactor , the Agency announced Wednesday -LSB- 11 May -RSB- .
48 48-278 279 1.0 false In addition , Agency inspectors would visit North Korea `` in the next few days `` if the replacement of the rods in the Yonbyon reactor was postponed , the IAEA said in a statement .
48 48-279 280 1.0 false U.S. officials say the change of fuel rods could provide enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear weapons .
48 48-280 281 1.0 false The Blix message was an answer to the North Korean foreign minister 's proposal on Friday that Pyongyang could negotiate with the IAEA over nuclear inspections and the presence of monitors to witness the fuel replacement .
48 48-281 282 1.0 false The Blix message was made public in Seoul following unconfirmed South Korean press reports that Washington had agreed to resume high-level talks with North Korea in return for the sampling of the fuel rods at a later date .
48 48-282 283 1.0 false The IAEA also said its team could finish inspecting a radiochemical laboratory , from which IAEA inspectors were barred by North Koreans last March , and check surveillance equipments at various nuclear facilities .
48 48-283 284 1.0 false In Vienna , IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the inspectors could leave for North Korea any time from Saturday if the response from Pyongyang was positive .
48 48-284 285 1.0 false Robert Gallucci , assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs , says the United States hopes to resume working-level contacts with North Korea in New York this week .
48 48-285 286 1.0 false `` We hope that this week we 'll be able to get back to North Korea -- almost certainly using the New York channel ...
48 48-286 287 1.0 false `` We have consulted our allies , particularly South Korea , that we 'll be able to go back to North Korea with a proposal , '' he said .
48 48-287 288 1.0 false One of these elements , of course , requires that North Korea maintain the continuity of safeguards , Gallucci said .
48 48-288 289 1.0 false `` Inter - Korean dialogue could also be an element , '' he said .
48 48-289 290 1.0 false `` Advancing inter - Korean dialogue in some modality would also figure in such an arrangement . ''
48 48-290 291 1.0 false Gallucci said the United States and its allies were not aiming to bring the North Korean nuclear issue back to the UN Security Council .
48 48-291 292 1.0 false `` It will not be sufficent for the IAEA inspectors to be in North Korea while this is happening .
48 48-292 293 1.0 false In any event , Gallucci said the United States would like to see North Korea 's nuclear program essentially frozen while `` we are engaged in these discussions . ''
48 48-293 294 1.0 false He added , however , this was not a precondition for U.S. - North Korean talks .
48 48-294 295 1.0 false NORTH KOREA yesterday raised fears of an international confrontation over its suspected nuclear weapons programme by declaring that it was withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
48 48-295 296 1.0 false North Korea would be the first country to scrap membership of the treaty , which seeks to limit the spread of nuclear technology .
48 48-296 297 1.0 false Mr Warren Christopher , the US secretary of state , threatened North Korea yesterday with possible international sanctions .
48 48-297 298 1.0 false Ms Madeleine Albright , US ambassador to the United Nations , said : 'We call upon North Korea to withdraw its declaration immediately . '
48 48-298 299 1.0 false The decision would halt inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency , which has carried out six inspections of North Korean facilities since Pyongyang permitted them last year .
48 48-299 300 1.0 false It suspects the sites are being used to store nuclear waste for re-processing of plutonium .
48 48-300 301 1.0 false However , Pyongyang responded that this was not possible at present because of the annual US / South Korean 'Team Spirit ' military exercises , now under way .
48 48-301 302 1.0 false North Korea insists that the two sites are non-nuclear military installations of no concern to IAEA inspectors .
48 48-302 303 1.0 false In Seoul , where the cabinet met in emergency session , the South Korean foreign ministry said : 'The North 's professed reasons for pulling out of the treaty convince no one .
48 48-303 304 1.0 false This only heightens the suspicion that it is developing nuclear arms . '
48 48-304 305 1.0 false The move threatened to undo recent progress in developing inter- Korean relations .
48 48-305 306 1.0 false China , a permanent member of the Security Council and one of North Korea 's few remaining allies , issued a mild rebuke to North Korea .
48 48-306 307 1.0 false SOUTH KOREA yesterday indicated that it would adopt a tougher attitude on the North Korean nuclear issue after Pyongyang rejected a proposal by Seoul to resume talks on mutual nuclear inspections .
48 48-307 308 1.0 false 'We gave everything we could give at the last round of North Korea - US high-level talks .
48 48-308 309 1.0 false Now it 's time to show Pyongyang what sticks are in store , ' said Mr Han Sung -joo , the South Korean foreign minister .
48 48-309 310 1.0 false The IAEA wants to examine sites to determine if North Korea is reprocessing more plutonium than it has disclosed , for possible use in developing nuclear weapons .
48 48-310 311 1.0 false Seoul refuses the Pyongyang demand for a summit , calling it 'premature ' until the nuclear dispute is resolved .
48 48-311 312 1.0 false But the IAEA is still barred from two nuclear waste sites .
48 48-312 313 1.0 false The IAEA demand to view these sites triggered North Korea 's announcement last March that it was withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , although it later suspended the threatened action after holding talks with the US .
48 48-313 314 1.0 false Mr Clinton 's assurances followed defiant statements from Pyongyang claiming that US demands for further inspections of nuclear sites were 'perfidious acts .
48 48-314 315 1.0 false creating a grave situation on the Korean peninsula , which may bring the Korean nation back to the phase of confrontation and war ' .
48 48-315 316 1.0 false In a letter to President Kim Young-sam , Mr Clinton also said that the US would defend South Korea if it is attacked by the North .
48 48-316 317 1.0 false Pyongyang yesterday maintained its defiant stance against concerted international pressure to open its nuclear sites to full inspections .
48 48-317 318 1.0 false North Korea threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if the US resumes its annual military exercise in South Korea and if the International Atomic Energy Agency decides that North Korea has not complied with its nuclear obligations .
48 48-318 319 1.0 false The UN Security Council may then consider economic sanctions on North Korea .
48 48-319 320 1.0 false Seoul also resumed preparations for the Team Spirit military exercise , although a decision on its timing has been delayed until President Kim Young-sam discusses the situation on the Korean peninsula with Chinese and Japanese leaders later this week .
48 48-320 321 1.0 false Mr Warren Christopher , US secretary of state , said US policy would take account of all the risks , but stressed that some form of international action was necessary to combat nuclear proliferation .

49 49-8 9 1.0 false The letter , dated Sept. 29 , carries Henderson 's name and asks recipients for contributions to Trettin 's campaign .
49 49-9 10 1.0 false Sills said he can not be held responsible for receiving the letter in Henderson 's council office and said he admonished Orr to send political material to Sills ' home .
49 49-10 11 1.0 false Orr , who described the letter as `` not one of my brighter '' actions , said the letter went out to Henderson 's political contributors this weekend .
49 49-11 12 1.0 false But she said that Sills ' `` head started clicking and maybe -LRB- he thought -RRB- 'she knows too much , and we ought to get rid of her , ' `` Ybarra said .
49 49-12 13 1.0 false Sills and the two political consultants identified by Ybarra -- Jean Andrews and Jack Orr -- denied Ybarra 's charges .
49 49-13 14 1.0 false Cristie McGuire , who oversees election matters , said she could not comment on Ybarra 's claims without more specific information .

57 57-7 8 1.0 false ANSWER : It makes a lot of sense to use a window air conditioner even though you have central air conditioning .
57 57-8 9 1.0 false Many new window air conditioners are significantly more efficient than your present central air conditioner .
57 57-9 10 1.0 false Instead of making a major expenditure for a new , more efficient central air conditioner , buying a relatively inexpensive , high-efficiency window or through-the-wall air conditioner is sometimes a better investment .
57 57-10 11 1.0 false By setting your central air conditioner 's thermostat five degrees higher , you can cut your electric bills up to 25 % , depending on your climate .
57 57-11 12 1.0 false Since it runs less , your central air conditioner should require fewer service calls .
57 57-12 13 1.0 false Super high-efficiency window air conditioners use special coil and fin designs to improve heat transfer and efficiency .
57 57-13 14 1.0 false These features improve the cool air distribution throughout the room or rooms and improve your comfort .
57 57-14 15 1.0 false At least it does according to Life magazine , which in 1975 listed the invention of air conditioning among the 100 events that most shaped America .
57 57-15 16 1.0 false Air conditioning changed America forever .
57 57-16 17 1.0 false Perhaps nowhere , however , has air conditioning made so personal an impact upon American life than in the home .
57 57-17 18 1.0 false In the 15 years since Life published its list of American milestones , residential air conditioning has gone from a luxury item to an expected part of daily life .
57 57-18 19 1.0 false In Orange County , air conditioning for the home took off with the residential building boom of the 1970s .
57 57-19 20 1.0 false And yet for large numbers of homeowners , air conditioning remains something of a mystery to be misunderstood and misused -- when it is n't being taken for granted , which is most of the time .
57 57-20 21 1.0 false Air conditioning , whether a central system or self-contained window unit , is basically a refrigerator turned extrovert .
57 57-21 22 1.0 false In an air conditioner , the cool gaseous Freon passes through coils in the evaporator inside the house where it absorbs heat from the warm interior air .
57 57-22 23 1.0 false Put simply , an air conditioner is like a man bailing out a boat -- except in this case the boat is your house , the water is heat , and the bucket is the Freon .
57 57-23 24 1.0 false Many people believe that an air conditioner somehow `` makes '' cold air .
57 57-24 25 1.0 false The cool breeze coming from the fan of an air conditioner is air that has lost something -- about 20 degrees of heat .
57 57-25 26 1.0 false As far as comfort goes , it is as important for an air conditioner to remove moisture from the air as it is to cool that air .
57 57-26 27 1.0 false This moisture removal is possible because the colder air becomes , the less water it can hold .
57 57-27 28 1.0 false As indoor air reaches its saturation point during the cooling process , the moisture it contains collects on fins inside the air conditioner and drains away .
57 57-28 29 1.0 false Think of how a glass of ice water `` sweats '' as warm air cools on contact and gives up its moisture .
57 57-29 30 1.0 false An air conditioner works much the same way .
57 57-30 31 1.0 false The failure to understand this process of dehumidification can lead a homeowner to choose the wrong air conditioner .
57 57-31 32 1.0 false Most people think bigger is better , says Mike Karsten , co-owner of Benchmark Air Systems Inc. in Anaheim .
57 57-32 33 1.0 false But an oversize system cools so rapidly that airborne moisture has little chance to condense on collection fins .
57 57-33 34 1.0 false `` People I run across in residential sales think choosing air conditioning is like buying a race car .
57 57-34 35 1.0 false That is n't the case with air conditioning .
57 57-35 36 1.0 false Most new homeowners do n't have to worry about picking the right air conditioner .
57 57-36 37 1.0 false `` Up until the mid-1970s , -LRB- residential -RRB- air conditioning was optional , '' Karsten says .
57 57-37 38 1.0 false During the `` optional period '' of the last 20 years , air conditioning proved popular and tens of thousands of units were installed .
57 57-38 39 1.0 false Ralph Luciano , sales representative for Trane , a large manufacturer of air conditioners , says units today are nearly twice as efficient as they were in the mid-1970s .
57 57-39 40 1.0 false `` Fifteen years ago , air conditioners probably ran at -LRB- an Energy Efficiency Rating of -RRB- five or six .
57 57-40 41 1.0 false A typical central air-conditioning system for a two -bedroom house may equal three to 3 1/2 tons of cooling capacity , or 36,000 to 42,000 BTUs . -RRB-
57 57-41 42 1.0 false Central air conditioners with EERs of 16 or more are gaining popularity with residential customers who want to get the most cooling bang for their energy buck , according to Luciano .
57 57-42 43 1.0 false Edison spokesman Kevin Kelley says customers also get billing discounts if they enroll in a `` cycling '' program that will automatically shut off selected residential air conditioners by radio remote control during peak demand times .
57 57-43 44 1.0 false Indoor air quality is a growing concern to homeowners , especially if a family member suffers from serious allergies .
57 57-44 45 1.0 false The ACRI also points out that a dirty filter is n't much good for anything except cutting air flow to your system .
57 57-45 46 1.0 false Keeping your cool by installing central air in a typical two -bedroom home can run $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 , according to Grupensperger .
57 57-46 47 1.0 false For those who want to beat the heat on a budget , there is the economy-class alternative to central cooling , the room air conditioner .
57 57-47 48 1.0 false Two years ago , an air conditioner slipped from a seventh -floor window in New York City and plunged to the sidewalk , killing a pedestrian .
57 57-48 49 1.0 false Of far more global concern than the errant air conditioner dropping from the sky is the use of chlorofluorocarbons that can escape and pose a threat to the ozone layer .
57 57-49 50 1.0 false Researchers have been experimenting with various approaches to air conditioning -- both old and new -- that would eliminate the need for CFCs .
57 57-50 51 1.0 false One promising device based on old technology cools air by blowing it through a water mist while at the same time managing the neat trick of removing humidity .
57 57-51 52 1.0 false It accomplishes this by adding a desiccant , lithium bromide , to the water to `` dry '' the air as it passes through the spray .
57 57-52 53 1.0 false If effective substitutes can be found , the millions of residential and commercial air conditioners now in use could be made ozone -friendly with a simple recharge of the new cooling agents .
57 57-53 54 1.0 false What are the newest and highest-efficiency heat pump designs -LRB- for both heating and air conditioning -RRB- available ?
57 57-54 55 1.0 false These new heat pumps may also be a cost-effective option for homes with natural gas furnaces and central air conditioners .
57 57-55 56 1.0 false A heat pump works both as a furnace and an air conditioner .
57 57-56 57 1.0 false When your heating or air conditioning needs are low to moderate , which is the majority of the time , the compressor runs at a lower speed .
57 57-57 58 1.0 false In the summer , improved comfort is even more dramatic because continuous and slower operation dehumidifies the air better .
57 57-58 59 1.0 false If you have a gas furnace and have to replace your central air conditioner , depending on your local utility rates , a high-efficiency heat pump may be a viable option .

58 58-10 11 1.0 false `` LARKS ON A STRING '' -LRB- Czechoslovakia , 1969 ; Director : Jiri Menzel ; Fairfax , 8 : 45 p.m. -RRB- .
58 58-11 12 1.0 false As in earlier films - Camera Buff , No End , A Short Film About Killing - the screen is a mystical assault-course of the ordinary made extraordinary .
58 58-12 13 1.0 false In each film a loved one dies , leaving the hero or heroine -LRB- s -RRB- to cope with that Great Emotional Beyond called bereavement .
58 58-13 14 1.0 false My handkerchief remained unused in Jacques Fansten 's Cross My Heart , although I might have taken it out to wave in surrender as the film keeps firing the same trite story ammunition at us .

58 58-16 17 1.0 false No major honour , I rue , for the best film of the final days , Georgia 's The Beloved .
58 58-17 18 1.0 false Seldom does a film festival act as midwife to an entire new sub-genre .
58 58-18 19 1.0 false But at Berlin a newcomer screamed into the daylight while critics gasped , onlookers applauded and everyone tried to determine whether it was a boy or a girl .
58 58-19 20 1.0 false At best the film is vividly personal , like animated pages torn from a diary .
58 58-20 21 1.0 false Lee 's film takes a similar plot and turns it into a crowd -pleaser that also makes dramatic and psychological sense .
58 58-21 22 1.0 false Nothing else in the Berlin Competition sent one out glowing like these two films .
58 58-22 23 1.0 false You winced as you stepped on Holland 's The Homecoming , a darkly ludicrous murder film shot as if by the light of a single candle .
58 58-23 24 1.0 false Since the film was co-produced by France and Germany , there are incongruous Euro - actors : notably Charlotte Gainsbourg , Birkin 's niece , as the daughter .
58 58-24 25 1.0 false They all sound as if they come the grungier reaches of British suburbia , and an initially unpromising film ends up holding you in sickly , sepulchral thrall .
58 58-25 26 1.0 false You recall that brouhaha : film pilloried by agit-gays right up to Oscar time for its picture of a -LRB- seemingly -RRB- homosexual serial killer .
58 58-26 27 1.0 false Ron Nyswaner 's script plots the film as a legal suspense story , using courtroom scenes to resolve Hanks 's unfair-dismissal suit against the firm that has soon pushed him off the payroll and torn up partnership promises .
58 58-27 28 1.0 false But what is Kafka , the second film from director Steven -LRB- sex , lies and videotape -RRB- Soderbergh , about ?

59 59-128 129 1.0 false Mr. Vice President , welcome to Honduras ; this is the press from my country .
59 59-129 130 1.0 false -LSB- Reporter -RSB- Mr. U.S. Vice President , President Endara announced today that the first withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Canal Zone will take place next week .

59 59-134 135 1.0 false With the United States and the vice president integrated as external partners of the BCIE , we would obviously have better access to funds from the United States .
59 59-135 136 1.0 false -LSB- Reporter -RSB- Mr. President , you have shown your willingness to accept all that he has promised here , but , what chances do we have that this will be complied with ?

6 6-0 1 1.0 true at the weekend Mr Koresh requested a word processor to enable him to record his revelations .
6 6-1 2 1.0 true over the weekend Mr Koresh sent a request for a word processor to enable him to record his revelations .
6 6-2 3 1.0 false Koresh explained that he was delaying until he had finished writing the revelations of the Twelfth Seal .
6 6-3 4 1.0 false The compound housing an estimated 95 followers of religious zealot Mr David Koresh was destroyed after three fires were started by members of the cult , possibly with kerosene , according to the FBI .
6 6-4 5 1.0 false The FBI said it believed Mr Koresh ordered a mass suicide and that there had been 'massive loss of life ' .
6 6-5 6 1.0 false Mr Koresh and all but nine of his followers were presumed dead .
6 6-6 7 1.0 false The FBI said that among the nine survivors were an Australian and two of the 26 Britons believed by the Foreign Office to have been in the compound .
6 6-7 8 1.0 false One survivor was quoted as saying that , after the fires were lit , Mr Koresh advised his followers to 'relax ' because they would soon be seeing 'the face of God ' .
6 6-8 9 1.0 false Attorney-general Janet Reno , who took responsibility for the FBI action , last night said the plan to move against the compound had appeared the best way to end the stand-off without bloodshed .
6 6-9 10 1.0 false She absolved President Clinton of blame , saying he knew only generally of the plan , and added that the FBI had 'acted professionally and with remarkable restraint ' .
6 6-10 11 1.0 false It started several hours after the FBI rammed the compound with tanks and fired tear- gas in an attempt to end the siege .
6 6-11 12 1.0 false Only last week Mr Koresh warned FBI agents that they would be 'devoured ' by fire if they tried to harm him .
6 6-12 13 1.0 false But the FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait .
6 6-13 14 1.0 false At 5.55am local time yesterday the cult was telephoned and informed that the FBI would begin to fire teargas into the compound .
6 6-14 15 1.0 false A fire , which the White House said was deliberately started by followers of religious zealot Mr David Koresh , destroyed the compound where the cult members had been holed up .
6 6-15 16 1.0 false The White House said FBI agents were doing everything possible to rescue the 95 cult followers from the compound and that at least 20 people had left .
6 6-16 17 1.0 false Seventeen children under 10 years old were believed to be inside the compound with Mr Koresh and his followers .
6 6-17 18 1.0 false 'They 're still pulling people out , ' a White House official said , adding that the FBI did not know how many would survive the fire .
6 6-18 19 1.0 false FBI agents pulled out of the compound one reluctant woman who did not want to leave .
6 6-19 20 1.0 false talk to the attorney-general or the FBI .
6 6-20 21 1.0 false There was no immediate indication of what happened to Mr Koresh , the religious leader who believes he is the incarnation of Jesus Christ .
6 6-21 22 1.0 false Mr Koresh last week disappointed federal agents by failing to surrender on weapons and other charges resulting from the raid , which left four agents dead , that began the stand-off .
6 6-22 23 1.0 false The FBI was evidently no longer prepared to wait .
6 6-23 24 1.0 false Mr Bob Ricks , the FBI agent in charge of the operation , said the teargas was fired to 'make them as uncomfortable as possible ' .
6 6-24 25 1.0 false So why did Gran and Marks get it wrong ?
6 6-25 26 1.0 false Anything but clear , as we were reminded by Panorama ; Sinful Messiah -LRB- BBC 1 , Monday -RRB- is whether the FBI were justified in mounting the assault on the Branch Davidian headquarters .
6 6-26 27 1.0 false Fresh material given to Panorama , a taped conversation between cult-leader David Koresh and his lawyer late in the siege , suggests that Koresh did not want mass-suicide .
6 6-27 28 1.0 false This the FBI dismissed as mere bluff , so Koresh 's deadline was literally that .
60 60-0 1 1.0 true The normal Concorde return fare between London and New York is more than Pounds 5,000 and the airline takes more than Pounds 150m a year in ticket revenues from its small fleet .
60 60-1 2 1.0 true The round-trip fare on normal Concorde flights , between New York and London , for example , is about $ 6,400 .
60 60-2 3 1.0 false For them the premium New York return fare of Pounds 5,000 is justified by the savings in travelling time offered by Concorde .
60 60-3 4 1.0 false A standard British Airways return fare to New York costs Pounds 5,030 plus tax - Pounds 670 per hour on board - while a cheap-day Concorde return is priced at Pounds 4,156 .
60 60-4 5 1.0 false The group has been concentrating on three main issues , the technological requirements for a second generation supersonic airliner , environmental considerations and finally the potential market for the new jet .
60 60-5 6 1.0 false Like the airlines , the aerospace industry believes the only real questions are when a new supersonic aircraft will be built , and who will be in the final consortium .
60 60-6 7 1.0 false Concorde , with its payload of only 100 seats , has always been viewed as a 'top persons ' airliner ' , with a premium fare which has limited its market .
60 60-7 8 1.0 false The range is critical because it would open up new high density routes such as the trans-Pacific routes from America 's west coast to Asia , for instance Los Angeles to Tokyo .
60 60-8 9 1.0 false Such an aircraft could cut many long distance journey times in half and help attract new travellers to supersonic flight .
60 60-9 10 1.0 false Another Concorde idea for the festive season is the so-called Atlantic Time Tunnel which offers the chance to celebrate New Year 's Eve twice in the same year .
60 60-10 11 1.0 false Two nights later , Concorde takes you on to New York for a Bloomingdale 's reception -LRB- Dollars 10,000 to spend for one lucky passenger -RRB- and from there , on January 3 , back to London .
60 60-11 12 1.0 false The standard Concorde return fare to Barbados is Pounds 4,228 .
60 60-12 13 1.0 false They will not be those for whom Concorde is merely a rapid means of shuttling between important meetings in London , New York and Washington .
60 60-13 14 1.0 false They will be seeking cash aid from national governments and from Brussels for the project , which is estimated to cost the makers as much as Dollars 15bn -LRB- Pounds 10.20bn -RRB- for a maximum demand of 1,000 aircraft .
60 60-14 15 1.0 false It has been in discussion with the UK Department of Trade and Industry about assistance for the new project .
60 60-15 16 1.0 false British Airways yesterday said it was suspending its loss-making Concorde scheduled service between London and Washington DC after 18 years .
60 60-16 17 1.0 false BA , which will continue to operate its profitable twice-daily London - New York Concorde services , plans to develop supersonic charter flights for the US market .
60 60-17 18 1.0 false After the end of its thrice-weekly scheduled Concorde Washington service from November 8 BA will permanently base one of its seven Concordes at New York 's JFK airport .
60 60-18 19 1.0 false BA has already won business to operate a weekly Concorde charter flight between New York and Barbados for three months starting in December .
60 60-19 20 1.0 false BA said : 'We see possibilities for expanding charter services from New York to South America , Bermuda and Mexico . '
60 60-20 21 1.0 false The trip will start in London on April 1 and finish there on April 23 .
60 60-21 22 1.0 false The fare is $ 39,000 per person based on double occupancy or $ 40,500 for a single passenger .
61 61-0 1 1.0 true If you want to try a Cuban white rum you would be better off with Havana Club .
61 61-1 2 1.0 false The radio also reports that innovators from the Ministry of Construction 's Enterprise No. 1 in Pinar del Rio Province have developed a cement-hardener made from molasses and other materials available locally .
61 61-2 3 1.0 false Rum is distilled wherever sugar cane is grown and in a few places where it is not .
61 61-3 4 1.0 false Some rums from the former Spanish colonies were predictably fashioned for the sweet-toothed : Ron Colonial , a golden rum from Guatamala , or Ron Artemi from the Canary Islands , for example .
61 61-4 5 1.0 false Both a white rum , and a three-year-old , golden , banana-smelling rum are available here .
61 61-5 6 1.0 false Most are made in column stills which produce a less pungent spirit than that made in Jamaica , and one which needs a longer process of maturation .
61 61-6 7 1.0 false Martinique white rums do n't impress me much , perhaps because I am reluctant to see any drink submerged beneath a liquidised fruit cocktail .
61 61-7 8 1.0 false The 1966 was a dream , an absolute must for anyone who doubts rum 's ability to hold its own among the world 's great digestifs .
61 61-8 9 1.0 false From the Domaine de Montebello came a 1948 rum which was magnificently spicy : cinnamon , cloves and ginger .
61 61-9 10 1.0 false In the old British colonies many of the rums were made in pot stills using molasses as opposed to the cane juice preferred by the French .
61 61-10 11 1.0 false Ben Cross de Chavannes , a veteran rum trader , showed me some startling figures relating to the ester-count in Jamaican rums .
61 61-11 12 1.0 false During the Great War these were the only spirits made available to the Jamaicans , and they developed a taste for them .
61 61-12 13 1.0 false Anyone wishing to try a subtle white rum from a British island , should sample The Baron 's CSR from St Kitts , which is remarkably smooth .
61 61-13 14 1.0 false Cockspur is a golden rum with a well-mannered drink with a faintly nutmeg-like aroma .
61 61-14 15 1.0 false Two rather more house -tamed rums are El Dorado Demerara rum -LRB- from Guyana -RRB- and Alfred Lamb reserve .
61 61-15 16 1.0 false The 15-year-old Guyanese rum has a smell which reminded me of angelica .
62 62-0 1 1.0 true Although MS has been the subject of intensive research activity worldwide , there is still no effective treatment for the disease , in which the body 's immune system attacks the protective coating of myelin protein around nerve fibres .
62 62-1 2 1.0 true In MS , white blood cells -LRB- T- cells -RRB- destroy the protein sheath called myelin which protects nerve fibres .
62 62-2 3 1.0 true But the progress of MS is variable .
62 62-3 4 1.0 true In MS , some of the person 's immune cells inexplicably attack the nerve cells ' insulating sheaths .
62 62-4 5 1.0 false US scientists have identified the rogue immune cells that are responsible for multiple sclerosis .
62 62-5 6 1.0 false The discovery by Stanford University researchers working with Neurocrine Biosciences , a San Diego -based biotechnology company , could lead eventually to a cure for MS , which afflicts more than 2.6m people worldwide .
62 62-6 7 1.0 false By good fortune , it turns out that the same genetic sequence causes MS in rats ; having an animal model always speeds up drug development .
62 62-7 8 1.0 false Once a blocking technique has been developed , it may eventually become possible to use 'growth factors ' to repair the damaged tissues in MS patients .
62 62-8 9 1.0 false But the ultimate cause of MS - what triggers the T- cells to attack - is not yet understood .
62 62-9 10 1.0 false Demand for the first drug proven to have an effect against multiple sclerosis , Betaseron , outstrips supply to such an extent that a lottery is used to decide which patients should receive it .
62 62-10 11 1.0 false When Schering of Germany launched Betaseron last September in the US , the only country in which it is licensed for sale , doctors registered 80,000 MS patients who wanted the drug .
62 62-11 12 1.0 false Meanwhile two competing beta-interferons , developed by Ares-Serono of Switzerland and Biogen of the US , are moving through clinical trials in MS patients .
62 62-12 13 1.0 false Besides the interferons , many other 'new generation ' MS drugs are at various stages of research and development .
62 62-13 14 1.0 false Together they represent progress on a broad front against MS , the most common disease of the nervous system in young adults , which affects an estimated 2m people worldwide .
62 62-14 15 1.0 false Effective MS treatments could give the pharmaceutical industry a huge new market .
62 62-15 16 1.0 false Although the precise molecular cause of MS is not yet known , scientists agree that it is an auto-immune disease in the same broad category as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes .
62 62-16 17 1.0 false In the worst cases of 'chronic-progressive MS ' the neurological problems become steadily more severe and eventually kill the patient .
62 62-17 18 1.0 false In 'relapsing-remitting MS ' the disease flares up at unpredictable intervals - and may even disappear spontaneously .
62 62-18 19 1.0 false Neither beta-interferon nor the other experimental drugs can cure MS but , for the first time , they do promise a significant amelioration in the disease .
62 62-19 20 1.0 false Researchers also claimed success with drugs such as cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin , which suppress the patient 's whole immune system , but these too turned out to be ineffective against MS when tested properly .
62 62-20 21 1.0 false Tested under those conditions on patients with relapsing-remitting MS , Betaseron reduced the number of attacks by one third and reduced significantly the amount of nerve damage shown by magnetic resonance imaging .
62 62-21 22 1.0 false All three kinds - alpha , beta and gamma - have been tested on MS .
62 62-22 23 1.0 false Alpha had no effect , while gamma made the disease worse ; scientists now believe natural gamma-interferon may play a role in the progression of MS .
62 62-23 24 1.0 false Most of the other MS treatments under development aim to disable the specific part of the immune system that is responsible for MS , without suppressing the other immune functions that are essential for fighting disease .
62 62-24 25 1.0 false These are aimed either at specific types of T-cell which the researchers believe are responsible for the immune attack in MS or at 'antigens ' in the myelin which provoke the attack .
62 62-25 26 1.0 false If so , MS will be harder to treat .
62 62-26 27 1.0 false A broad series of experiments suggest that it may be possible to defuse the immune system in humans to treat and even prevent diseases like multiple sclerosis and diabetes .
62 62-27 28 1.0 false Moreover , researchers at Harvard are already using special antibodies in humans in an attempt to knock out MS patients ' own antibodies that are producing the disease .
62 62-28 29 1.0 false The Harvard researchers are also vaccinating some MS patients with immune cells in an attempt to protect them from the ravages of the disease .
62 62-29 30 1.0 false MS is a paralyzing neurological disease that affects as many as 250,000 people in the United States .
62 62-30 31 1.0 false In rodents and some other animals , an MS -like disease called experimental allergic encephalitis -LRB- EAE -RRB- can be produced by injecting the animals with ground-up nerve tissue .
62 62-31 32 1.0 false In an overreaction to the injected tissues , the animals ' immune systems begin to attack their own nerve tissues , producing MS symptoms .
62 62-32 33 1.0 false MS researchers in the past have used drugs that wipe out all T cells in an attempt to halt the progression of MS , but such drugs leave the MS patient highly susceptible to life-threatening infections .
62 62-33 34 1.0 false Neurologist Howard L. Weiner and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston have used such antibodies to treat about 20 human MS patients .
62 62-34 35 1.0 false Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurological disease that causes weakness , tremors and paralysis in as many as 250,000 Americans .
62 62-35 36 1.0 false Researchers in San Diego have developed a vaccine against an animal disease that mimics the effects of multiple sclerosis in humans , according to an article in Thursday 's issue of Science magazine .
62 62-36 37 1.0 false Continuing research in San Diego and elsewhere now suggests that doctors might one day be able to prevent and treat diseases such as MS and diabetes , both of which occur when the body 's immune system goes awry .
62 62-37 38 1.0 false MS is a chronic disease that causes weakness , tremors and paralysis .
62 62-38 39 1.0 false The San Diego -based researchers and the Portland group are using synthetic molecules to immunize mice against experimental allergic encephalitis -LRB- EAE -RRB- , an animal virus that produces MS -like symptoms .
62 62-39 40 1.0 false MS and EAE occur when the body is attacked by its own immune system .
62 62-40 41 1.0 false Lawrence Steinman , leader of the Stanford/Neurocrine research team , says the scientists are following three approaches : The primary effort is to make a 'molecular decoy ' which can attract the T- cells away from the myelin .
62 62-41 42 1.0 false The body 's immune system , which is intended to defend it against germs and other foreign invaders , turns against its own cells .
62 62-42 43 1.0 false Symptoms include partial paralysis , blurred vision and speech difficulties .
62 62-43 44 1.0 false Until now , doctors have only been able to offer patients 'comfort therapy ' such as pain- killers and anti-inflammatory drugs , which control some of the symptoms but have no effect on the underlying disease .
62 62-44 45 1.0 false According to Ares-Serono , it may both decrease the activity of the immune cells that destroy myelin and counteract the disease-enhancing effects of gamma-interferon .
62 62-45 46 1.0 false As a result they have sugar chains on the protein surface , like natural human interferon but unlike the Schering product .
62 62-46 47 1.0 false In theory this could give them a clinical advantage - in terms of fewer side-effects and improved efficacy - but there is no evidence to show whether they work better in practice .
62 62-47 48 1.0 false It suppresses harmful T- cells and may also stimulate the regrowth of damaged myelin .
62 62-48 49 1.0 false Myloral , a formulation of bovine -LRB- cow -RRB- myelin , developed by AutoImmune , a Massachusetts biotechnology company .
62 62-49 50 1.0 false The patient is fed the protein so that the immune system comes to tolerate it and therefore is less inclined to attack his or her own myelin .
62 62-50 51 1.0 false Copolymer-1 -LRB- Cop-1 -RRB- , a synthetic chemical resembling myelin protein , developed by Teva in Israel .
62 62-51 52 1.0 false When injected into the patient , this decoy attracts the immune cells away from the real myelin .
62 62-52 53 1.0 false Articles over the last six months have looked at pharmaceutical advances in the following areas : Sepsis 31 March Prostate 25 February Wound healing 21 January Obesity 23 December Contraceptives 12 November Anaesthetics 15 October
62 62-53 54 1.0 false `` I think it is going to be a source of great excitement in the neurological and virological communities . ''
62 62-54 55 1.0 false Olsen has found traces of the virus in patients with lupus , an autoimmune disorder in which the victims ' immune systems attack their connective tissues and internal organs .
62 62-55 56 1.0 false Olsen 's vaccine does not contain the virus itself , but proteins that are secreted by HTLV - 1 -infected animal cells that are grown in the laboratory .
62 62-56 57 1.0 false In the development of the feline leukemia virus , Olsen found that these precursor proteins produce a greater immune response than the viral proteins themselves and are less likely to produce harmful effects .
62 62-57 58 1.0 false That is an important finding , Olsen argued , because most potential AIDS vaccines now being studied use only one type of protein or the other , and are thus less likely to be effective .
62 62-58 59 1.0 false `` More than one protein is going to be necessary '' for an AIDS vaccine , he said in a telephone interview .
62 62-59 60 1.0 false But white blood cells from the nine vaccinated monkeys showed no evidence of viral activity , suggesting that the vaccine protected them from the virus .
62 62-60 61 1.0 false Olsen agrees , and is now using sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to search for the viral genes in white blood cells from the vaccinated monkeys .
62 62-61 62 1.0 false Only about 1 % of people infected by the virus actually develop disease , he said , so a vaccine would have to have a very low incidence of side effects to justify using it .
62 62-62 63 1.0 false The attack is carried out by immune cells , called T cells , that normally proliferate in response to an infection and destroy the foreign invader .
62 62-63 64 1.0 false The goal of most research now is to deactivate only those specific T cells that are attacking the nerve sheath while leaving the rest of the immune system intact .
62 62-64 65 1.0 false In passive immunization , the researchers attack the T cells that have already been formed .
62 62-65 66 1.0 false In an active approach , such as that reported today in the journal Nature , the researchers hope to prevent the formation of the destructive T cells in the first place .
62 62-66 67 1.0 false The immune system produced antibodies against the injected T cells -- and thus against the identical T cells produced by the animals ' bodies .
62 62-67 68 1.0 false These antibodies hold the T cells in check and thereby block progression of the disease .
62 62-68 69 1.0 false Weiner has already tried this approach in three human patients , isolating T cells from spinal fluid , deactivating them , and reinjecting them .
62 62-69 70 1.0 false When they vaccinated rats with the peptide , the rats no longer developed EAE when they were subsequently injected with ground nerve tissue .
62 62-70 71 1.0 false This approach is preferable to the use of whole cells because it is more widely applicable .
62 62-71 72 1.0 false In treating humans , the patient 's own deactivated cells must be used so that the injection does not cause an adverse immune reaction .
62 62-72 73 1.0 false In both diseases , cells that normally keep organisms healthy by destroying foreign cells inexplicably attack nerve cells and cause neurological diseases .
63 63-0 1 1.0 true NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Komsomolets nuclear-powered submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea five years ago : `` A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea is more than probable .
63 63-1 2 1.0 true The author of this book -- the assistant chief designer of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' -- offers his interpretation of the tragedy that played itself out in the Sea of Norway on 7 April 1989 .
63 63-2 3 1.0 true Russian specialists and scientists have proposed a unique method of preserving the submarine Komsomolets which sank 7 April 1989 in the Norwegian Sea approximately 180 miles southeast of Bear Island .
63 63-3 4 1.0 true The nuclear submarine Komsomolets has now been lying on the bottom of the Norwegian Sea for almost five years .
63 63-4 5 1.0 true The nuclear warheads of the torpedoes in the nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets that sank exactly five years ago in the Norwegian Sea remain intact .
63 63-5 6 1.0 true Russia 's Ministry for Emergencies plans to buy equipment that will make live telecast possible from the nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets that sunk in the Norwegian sea on April 7 , 1989 .
63 63-6 7 1.0 false KOPRON is being disbanded and so are the mobile structures carrying out active preparations for the conservation of warheads on the Komsomolets . ''
63 63-7 8 1.0 false This book was published with the assistance of the Nuclear- Powered Submarine `` Komsomolets '' Memorial Charity .
63 63-8 9 1.0 false The documentary narrative `` The Tragedy of the Submarine `` Komsomolets '' '' can not be considered to be the labor of a single author .
63 63-9 10 1.0 false A. Vanin 's poorly trained crew was sent off on that fateful cruise aboard the ill-prepared submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-10 11 1.0 false Different hypotheses regarding the causes of the tragedy of the Soviet nuclear-powered submarine `` Komsomolets '' have been stated in numerous articles published in a number of newspapers and journals by representatives of the navy .
63 63-11 12 1.0 false The submarine `` Komsomolets '' did not differ in any way from modern submarines currently in operation in terms of the composition of combat and technical resources , including its control systems and its damage control systems .
63 63-12 13 1.0 false In 1988 the submarine was recognized as an outstanding submarine , and it was awarded the name `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-13 14 1.0 false Preparation of the Submarine `` Komsomolets '' for Launching
63 63-14 15 1.0 false The Crew According to the detail design , the submarine `` Komsomolets '' should have been serviced by highly qualified specialists from among officers and warrant officer technicians .
63 63-15 16 1.0 false This reduction of professional level , `` planned '' by the navy 's elite , affected not only the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' but also all other submarines .
63 63-16 17 1.0 false `` Komsomolets '' crew members were questioned in a fault finding manner by the State Commission , which also contains representatives of industry .
63 63-17 18 1.0 false A news brief appeared in the 13 May 1989 edition of PRAVDA regarding decoration of the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-18 19 1.0 false Preparations for the Cruise : Routine inspection and maintenance and work to correct existing faults were carried out prior to the cruise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' in accordance with regulations .
63 63-19 20 1.0 false The trial run of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' demonstrated the need for creating such a crew .
63 63-20 21 1.0 false In order that the full volume of routine maintenance and inspection could be carried out within the established time aboard a `` Komsomolets '' class submarine , not less than 200 -250 highly qualified specialists must be brought in .
63 63-21 22 1.0 false Everything said here is completely valid in relation to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' as well .
63 63-22 23 1.0 false But let 's return to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-23 24 1.0 false An examination of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' with deep-sea submersibles in August - September 1991 revealed that it lacked an aft outboard television camera .
63 63-24 25 1.0 false Such was the `` readiness '' of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the difficult cruise .
63 63-25 26 1.0 false And so , on 28 February 1989 the submarine `` Komsomolets '' set off on its cruise .
63 63-26 27 1.0 false On 8 August 1988 the naval command and the USSR Ministry of Ship Building Industry adopted a joint decision to use the `` Komsomolets '' purposefully , in a special scientific research program .
63 63-27 28 1.0 false Such are the myths and realities regarding the goals of the last cruise of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-28 29 1.0 false The Submarine `` Komsomolets '' on Patrol
63 63-29 30 1.0 false I have before me the `` Extract From the Draft Ship 's Log of the Nuclear-Powered Submarine `` Komsomolets '' '' authenticated by the Northern Fleet chief of staff Vice Admiral Yu .
63 63-30 31 1.0 false There was one aboard the `` Komsomolets '' as well .
63 63-31 32 1.0 false As was mentioned earlier , the `` Manual on Combat Use of Technical Resources '' -LRB- RBITS -RRB- had not been written by Naval Institute No. 1 for the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-32 33 1.0 false 2 . The deflagration did not start a fire in the compartment , which says something about the rather high fire resistance of the `` Komsomolets '' submarine .
63 63-33 34 1.0 false At 1250 the headquarters of the Northern Fleet transmitted a radio message to the `` Komsomolets '' forbidding the ship 's submergence and suggesting it remain adrift .
63 63-34 35 1.0 false Apparently the command of the `` Komsomolets '' lacked not only the ability to organize ship damage control efforts but also the courage to report the status of the submarine objectively and promptly .
63 63-35 36 1.0 false This is apparently the result of the `` Komsomolets '' leadership misinforming the Northern Fleet command .
63 63-36 37 1.0 false And even in these last minutes of the tragedy , the leadership of the `` Komsomolets '' lacked the courage to communicate the whole truth to the Northern Fleet 's command post .
63 63-37 38 1.0 false As an example he cited the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-38 39 1.0 false Just due to this , members of the `` Komsomolets '' crew failed to put on survival suits , and did not take their safety vests and life jackets .
63 63-39 40 1.0 false The one thing that the leadership of the `` Komsomolets '' did manage to do was to report to the Northern Fleet 's command post back at 1641 that the personnel were ready for evacuation .
63 63-40 41 1.0 false The `` Komsomolets '' is the only submarine in the navy that carries rafts outside the pressure hull .
63 63-41 42 1.0 false The rafts of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' were in hard containers , each with two rack -and -pinion releases .
63 63-42 43 1.0 false At 1645 the Northern Fleet commander ordered the commander of the `` Komsomolets '' to prepare the rescue chamber -LRB- VSK -RRB- for separation from the submarine .
63 63-43 44 1.0 false As is the case aboard other submarines , the rescue chamber of the `` Komsomolets '' is intended for the rescue of the entire crew when the submarine is on the bottom .
63 63-44 45 1.0 false The submarine `` Komsomolets '' began sinking with a trim of around 80ë by the stern .
63 63-45 46 1.0 false The ignorance of the personnel of the `` Komsomolets '' of the physical laws and principles of action of the rescue chamber releasing devices can be clearly discerned in this episode .
63 63-46 47 1.0 false Ship 's Clock of the Submarine `` Komsomolets ''
63 63-47 48 1.0 false This discussion of hydraulic shock is based on the practical experience of designing the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-48 49 1.0 false The rest of the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was continuing its fight for its life during this time .
63 63-49 50 1.0 false They have obviously exhausted the limit of their concern for the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , such that there was not enough left for giving three submariners a decent human burial in the ground .
63 63-50 51 1.0 false Concluding my narration of the actions of the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' during the accident , it would be wrong not to mention the heroic and self-sacrificing actions of certain members of the crew .
63 63-51 52 1.0 false Weak combat and occupational training of the crew led to the tragic outcome of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-52 53 1.0 false 4 . There is no evidence that the submarine `` Komsomolets '' went to sea with a serviceable oxygen gas analyzer and with a serviceable television system .
63 63-53 54 1.0 false There still are numerous unanswered questions in the investigation of the circumstances of the accident of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-54 55 1.0 false The `` Komsomolets '' was not `` a vessel intended for experimentation , '' but an experimental ship -- that is , an experimental model of armament .
63 63-55 56 1.0 false It was for these purposes that the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was created .
63 63-56 57 1.0 false The government decree on adoption of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' by the navy was coordinated with many military leaders , including the naval commander -in- chief and the USSR minister of defense .
63 63-57 58 1.0 false In this respect , contrary to Captain 1st Rank Kolyada 's opinion , the submarine `` Komsomolets '' did not require any additional certification .
63 63-58 59 1.0 false It has its own history , one which has no relationship to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-59 60 1.0 false And so this unseemly history culminated with slander directed at the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-60 61 1.0 false It reads : `` The `` Komsomolets '' was a unique submarine , and its design deficiencies were also unique in their own way .
63 63-61 62 1.0 false The fact that even after that deflagration occurred in compartment 5 a fire did n't start in it also attests to the fire safety of compartments of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-62 63 1.0 false If the fire aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' had not been extinguished by means of this system , this system is not at fault : fire extinguisher was not delivered to the distressed compartment .
63 63-63 64 1.0 false The authors assert that `` as in Chernobyl , the disaster aboard the `` Komsomolets '' was embodied in its design. ''
63 63-64 65 1.0 false Relax , comrade scientists , everything is in order with the official name of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-65 66 1.0 false To reassure you , let me give you the full official name of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' : `` deep-sea large nuclear-powered torpedo submarine . ''
63 63-66 67 1.0 false The author writes : `` The fire aboard the `` Komsomolets '' was altogether unprecedented .
63 63-67 68 1.0 false How far must we go in the effort to somehow find fault with the submarine `` Komsomolets '' ? !
63 63-68 69 1.0 false But at least because it was the first of its kind , as is true with all prototype ships , initially the `` Komsomolets '' needed further design improvements -- that is , it was not perfect .
63 63-69 70 1.0 false Still , we should be thankful to the writer for his high assessment of the deep-sea qualities of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-70 71 1.0 false As for specific complaints regarding the design of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , there is nothing to say -- Boyko simply did n't have any .
63 63-71 72 1.0 false Fire detection equipment was foreseen aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-72 73 1.0 false The detail design of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was developed to include an LOKh firefighting system equipped with remote control from the control room .
63 63-73 74 1.0 false As the division deputy commander Captain 1st Rank Kolyada bears a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that such recommendations were not drawn up for the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-74 75 1.0 false 9 . In conclusion we need to examine the `` numerous design imperfections '' revealed in the investigation of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-75 76 1.0 false In August 1990 the USSR Council of Ministers published a decree on the results of the examination of the circumstances behind the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , drafted by the naval leadership .
63 63-76 77 1.0 false Such placement of panels is characteristic of all of the navy 's submarines , and it is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-77 78 1.0 false The oil reserve 's location in the aft compartment is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-78 79 1.0 false As for the overall amount of equipment , compartment 7 aboard the `` Komsomolets '' has less than any of the others .
63 63-79 80 1.0 false There are significantly fewer such openings aboard the `` Komsomolets '' than in other submarines of the navy .
63 63-80 81 1.0 false In particular there are 53 openings in the pressure hull in the aft compartment of a certain third-generation submarine with a compartment 7 of the same size as that in the `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-81 82 1.0 false There were only 38 openings in the pressure hull in compartment 7 of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-82 83 1.0 false 4 . The assertion of the authors of the remark that the distribution panels aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' are not protected from the influence of oil vapor is inconsistent with reality .
63 63-83 84 1.0 false This system for removing oil vapor from air is also used aboard other submarines of the navy , and the `` Komsomolets '' is not unique in this .
63 63-84 85 1.0 false In all of the time that the `` Komsomolets '' was in operation , not a single case of oil getting on equipment in any compartment was documented .
63 63-85 86 1.0 false The detail design of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' had already been approved by this time -LRB- 1972 -RRB- , and the shop drawings were practically finished .
63 63-86 87 1.0 false The submarine `` Komsomolets '' was designed in accordance with specifications approved in 1966 , and the TPPL-67 submarine design requirements , developed by the navy .
63 63-87 88 1.0 false 11.4.26 of the TPPL-75 were satisfied in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , with the exception of requirements on using KMZh cable in emergency electric power networks .
63 63-88 89 1.0 false The `` consequences '' of imagined peculiarities of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' dreamed up by the authors are also inconsistent with reality .
63 63-89 90 1.0 false However , the RBITS never was written by the Naval Institute No. 1 , and the navy 's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair did not plan or support its development for the `` Komsomolets '' in time .
63 63-90 91 1.0 false The detail design for the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was drawn up with an LOKh system that could be started remotely from the attack center in accordance with requirements of the specifications and the TPPL- 67 .
63 63-91 92 1.0 false A manually started LOKh system is used on most submarines , and therefore the assertion of the authors of the remark that this was a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is inconsistent with reality .
63 63-92 93 1.0 false In this case for unknown reasons the navy decided not to install the system in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , and it did not foresee completion of these developments for this ship .
63 63-93 94 1.0 false It is consequently wrong for the navy to lodge any complaints about the absence of a remotely started LOKh system aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-94 95 1.0 false The LOKh system in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was developed in full correspondence with naval requirements OTT MO 6.1.17-79 ,
63 63-95 96 1.0 false 2 . None of the navy 's submarines has containers with a freon reserve , and this is also not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-96 97 1.0 false 4 . The instructions on operating the LOKh system were developed for the submarine `` Komsomolets '' in accordance with standard instructions coordinated with the navy , which say nothing about the fire extinguishing characteristics of freon .
63 63-97 98 1.0 false Consequently any discussion of the absence of these resources aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is pointless and totally meaningless .
63 63-98 99 1.0 false Such protection is absent from all submarines of the navy that have the `` Korund '' system , such that this is also not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-99 100 1.0 false In light of the above , the so-called `` consequences '' of the imagined peculiarities of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' have no real basis .
63 63-100 101 1.0 false do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the `` peculiarities. ''
63 63-101 102 1.0 false The electric power systems of all submarines of the navy are built on the basis of this principle , such that this is not a peculiarity of just the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-102 103 1.0 false Most submarines of the navy are made with the kingstonless design , and this is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-103 104 1.0 false 2 . The TPPL-67 , in accordance with which the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was designed , does not contain a requirement of mandatory installation of kingston valves in main ballast tanks .
63 63-104 105 1.0 false For the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 , the requirements of the TPPL-75 do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-105 106 1.0 false At the time of the accident of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' the sea state was around 2 - 3 points , and its influence upon the ship 's buoyancy reserve was negligible .
63 63-106 107 1.0 false The high-pressure air system aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was built in accordance with OST V5.5017-79 , and it is similar in its structure to the same systems of other submarines of the navy .
63 63-107 108 1.0 false The assertion of the authors of the remark that this system is unique to the `` Komsomolets '' is inconsistent with reality .
63 63-108 109 1.0 false All of the discussion concerning absence of these automated systems and instruments aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' are directed at consciously and deliberately misleading public opinion .
63 63-109 110 1.0 false do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the `` peculiarities , '' and any reference to them is wrong .
63 63-110 111 1.0 false As for the `` consequences , '' the following needs to be said : The attack center of the `` Komsomolets '' did nothing to study the objective information on the course of events in the accident situation .
63 63-111 112 1.0 false Such that its absence from the `` Komsomolets '' is not a peculiarity of this submarine .
63 63-112 113 1.0 false 3 . RAVA hoses are used aboard all submarines built in recent years , and their use aboard the `` Komsomolets '' is not unique to this submarine .
63 63-113 114 1.0 false The assertion that the reliability of electric power equipment in systems in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' is low is not justified by anything , and is inconsistent with reality .
63 63-114 115 1.0 false Materials corresponding to OST V5.9025-80 and the `` Statute on Selection of Nonmetallic Structural Materials for Submarines '' No. 74 - 0450 - 06-78 were used to trim compartments of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' , including compartment 7 .
63 63-115 116 1.0 false They are used to trim the compartments of all submarines of the navy , such that this is not a peculiarity of the `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-116 117 1.0 false these requirements do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the `` peculiarities. ''
63 63-117 118 1.0 false This requirement was satisfied to a realistic extent aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-118 119 1.0 false The stationary breathing system -LRB- SDS -RRB- of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was developed in full correspondence with guidelines RD V5.5536-82 ,
63 63-119 120 1.0 false Such systems were developed for all submarines according to the same principle , and it is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-120 121 1.0 false The requirements of Article VII-7 of the TPPL-67 are satisfied in their full volume in the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-121 122 1.0 false According to the detail design the crew of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' should have consisted of 41 persons , in which case the number of personnel in BCh-5 should have been 19 officers and warrant officers .
63 63-122 123 1.0 false 2 . The submarine `` Komsomolets '' set off on its cruise without the full complement of personnel in the damage control division of BCh- 5 -LRB- Warrant Officer Yu .
63 63-123 124 1.0 false About the `` consequences '' : Analysis of damage control efforts aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' shows that : 1 .
63 63-124 125 1.0 false The `` Listvennitsa '' loudspeaker communication system -LRB- GGS -RRB- is installed aboard all submarines of the navy , in connection with which this is not a peculiarity of only the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-125 126 1.0 false Not a single submarine of the navy has such a system , and therefore its absence from the `` Komsomolets '' is not unique to the ship .
63 63-126 127 1.0 false These recommendations were obviously not drawn up , and they were not studied by the personnel of the `` Komsomolets '' during submarine damage control exercises .
63 63-127 128 1.0 false The air systems of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' do not differ from the systems of other third-generation submarines , and they are in no way `` unique. ''
63 63-128 129 1.0 false do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in paragraph 1 of the `` peculiarities. ''
63 63-129 130 1.0 false concerning system back-up were fully realized in the `` Komsomolets '' , while the requirements of Article 1.3.3.1 of the OTT6 .1.1 - 81
63 63-130 131 1.0 false The above assertions of the authors of the remark are aimed at covering up the incorrect actions of the attack center of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-131 132 1.0 false The emergency pumping system aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets '' was built in accordance with the OST , and it did not differ in any way from similar systems aboard other submarines .
63 63-132 133 1.0 false The assertion of the authors of the remark that the design of the emergency pumping system is a `` peculiarity '' of the `` Komsomolets '' is inconsistent with reality .
63 63-133 134 1.0 false 2 . The requirements of the TPPL-75 do not apply to the submarine `` Komsomolets '' for the reasons set forth in the conclusion regarding item 1 of the `` peculiarities. ''
63 63-134 135 1.0 false Aboard the `` Komsomolets '' , these valves had manual and hydraulic drives .
63 63-135 136 1.0 false The `` consequences '' have the goal of covering up the inaction of the attack center of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' in containing the accident and fighting for the ship 's survival .
63 63-136 137 1.0 false They returned me once again to the question of the roots of the tragedy of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' .
63 63-137 138 1.0 false The tragedy of the submarine `` Komsomolets '' occurred 33 years later , and once again for the same reasons .

63 63-141 142 1.0 false The submarine `` Komsomolets '' had only an emergency reserve of regenerating cartridges .
63 63-142 143 1.0 false The Komsomolets could dive to 1,000 meters , whereas an ordinary submarine could only go as far as 400 to 600 meters .
63 63-143 144 1.0 false The Komsomolets was to have destroyed missile-armed submarines and carrier strike groups composed of aircraft carriers and escort ships , and it could also direct long-range fire against onshore targets ... .
63 63-144 145 1.0 false However , the Komsomolets was in fact unable to serve the Motherland .
63 63-145 146 1.0 false Others insisted on dismembering the Komsomolets with a view to coaxing each part out of the watery depths separately .
63 63-146 147 1.0 false Another very simple method would be to latch onto the Komsomolets with a kind of lasso and tow it toward the shore ... .
63 63-147 148 1.0 false The aim was to establish the real reason for the wreck of the Komsomolets and to remove the torpedoes with nuclear charges .
63 63-148 149 1.0 false The Komsomolets is lying level on an even keel .
63 63-149 150 1.0 false For the first time our specialists were able to go inside the Komsomolets using remote-control robots .
63 63-150 151 1.0 false Robots the size of large vacuum cleaners entered the Komsomolets through gaps in the hull and two open portholes .
63 63-151 152 1.0 false While the Komsomolets was ablaze on the surface , military pilots photographed it from the air .
63 63-152 153 1.0 false This is why specialists have started to look for a way of neutralizing the Komsomolets that avoids having to bring it to the surface .
63 63-153 154 1.0 false But calculations have shown that on soft ground with a density of just 1.8 , the Komsomolets could break up .

63 63-160 161 1.0 false The Northern Fleet Press Office emphasized that radiation was continuously monitored in the area where Komsomolets had sunk .
63 63-161 162 1.0 false Today 's Moscow press singles out reports on the Komsomolets nuclear-powered submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea as a result of a fire five years ago .
63 63-162 163 1.0 false Pyzh added that the Northern Fleet command wanted reports and forecasts on what was going on or would happen where Komsomolets had sunk to be based on specific tests and accurate data .
63 63-163 164 1.0 false They are to seal off the submarine 's front section , conduct technical tests on the vessel and check its inflated safe chamber , lying on the sea bed six kilometers from Komsomolets .
63 63-164 165 1.0 false The Deputy Director of the Federal Nuclear Center Arzamas-16 Stepan Kravchenko disclosed at the meeting that a new device would be installed on board Komsomolets to detect uranium and plutonium carrying weapons .

63 63-170 171 1.0 false In a few days , on April 7 , it will be exactly five years since the loss of the submarine Komsomolets and 42 of its crewmen in the Norwegian Sea .
63 63-171 172 1.0 false And this can easily be explained : In the time since the Komsomolets went down , Russians have witnessed a sizable number of disasters and accidents .
63 63-172 173 1.0 false A brief surge in attention to the Komsomolets problem occurred in September 1993 , when the fourth expedition to study the site where the submarine sunk returned from the Norwegian Sea .
63 63-173 174 1.0 false Despite such bleak forecasts , however , the specialists studying the Komsomolets problem were confident that a radiation disaster could nonetheless be prevented .
63 63-174 175 1.0 false In addition , CSUO chief Tengiz Borisov managed to do the almost impossible : Financing for all operations involving the Komsomolets was included in the state order .
63 63-175 176 1.0 false And these two `` natural calamities '' have posed an insurmountable obstacle to solving the Komsomolets problem .
63 63-176 177 1.0 false And while one can still understand the unhurried actions of the Ministry of Environmental Protection , the position of the department that now bears full responsibility for the Komsomolets 's fate seems inexplicable , at first glance .
63 63-177 178 1.0 false Sergey Khetagurov , former chairman of the North Ossetian Council of Ministers , who switched chairs to become deputy minister for emergencies , has been put in charge of all measures relating to the Komsomolets .
63 63-178 179 1.0 false Meanwhile , the problem of making the Komsomolets safe has taken on a new , international aspect .
63 63-179 180 1.0 false One such organization is the Komsomolets Memorial Foundation , which was created in Holland and has announced to the entire world that it is raising funds to raise the submarine .
63 63-180 181 1.0 false To properly assess this amount , it must be said that Russia itself spent an incomparably greater sum -- $ 4 million and 1 billion rubles -- on operations relating to the Komsomolets in that same year alone .
63 63-181 182 1.0 false In addition , rather large suspended radioactive particles that can be transported by currents were found at the Komsomolets site in August 1993 .
63 63-182 183 1.0 false He reports that , despite the real possibility of a volley discharge of weapons-grade plutonium into the marine environment from the sunken Komsomolets , the expedition to it and the actual sealing of the vessel are in jeopardy .
63 63-183 184 1.0 false Why does the situation with regard to the sunken Komsomolets elicit such increased attention and such contradictory assessments ?
63 63-184 185 1.0 false The question of ensuring the Komsomolets ' radiation safety is far more serious than other similar tragic instances .
63 63-185 186 1.0 false Nursultan Nazarbayev , who is , perhaps , the strongest politician among CIS presidents , proved to the Kremlin these months which are far from being a honeymoon , that it is necessary for Russian to reckon with him .
63 63-186 187 1.0 false `` However , no other country in the world should be more interested in a strong and stable Kazakhstan than Russia , since the newly-independent state has become the most reliable buffer between Russian and explosive Central Asia .
63 63-187 188 1.0 false Kazakhstan is the world 's only country where the activities of the Russian community , Cossack and Slavic associations are banned juridically . ''
63 63-188 189 1.0 false Considering that plutonium 's period of semi-decay is 24,000 years , the sea in that sector would turn out to be unfit for fisheries over a span of 600 -700 years '' .
63 63-189 190 1.0 false However , as has become known , thanks to research carried out by Russian shore-based scientists , the reactor does not pose a serious ecological threat .
63 63-190 191 1.0 false If plutonium escapes into the sea it could cause serious ecological danger .
63 63-191 192 1.0 false His opinion regarding the causes of the accident and demise of the submarine , which is based on documented testimony , contradicts the conclusions reached by the government commission .
63 63-192 193 1.0 false Let 's listen to the opinion of workers of the Main Naval Staff : `` As far as causes bringing about the accident are concerned , numerous technical imperfections in the submarine 's various systems should be named first .
63 63-193 194 1.0 false And he concluded : `` Despite the self-sacrificing and technically competent actions by the personnel , it was impossible to save the submarine . ''
63 63-194 195 1.0 false Nuclear-powered attack submarines are the most complex , potentially dangerous and vulnerable objects in this respect .
63 63-195 196 1.0 false `` After its commissioning , the submarine underwent experimental operation for several years .

63 63-197 198 1.0 false A. Vanin 's crew was the second crew of this submarine , and the cruise that began on 28 February 1989 and ended in the tragedy of 7 April was its first independent cruise .
63 63-198 199 1.0 false We will also examine the `` numerous technical imperfections '' supposedly present in this submarine , which in the opinion of the naval leadership helped to bring about the accident .
63 63-199 200 1.0 false In what matter were the circumstances of the submarine accident investigated ?
63 63-200 201 1.0 false In the letter mentioned above from the submarine commanders , it is asserted that the crew had corrected the shortcomings revealed in work on damage control problems , and completed them with a good grade .
63 63-201 202 1.0 false In early January 1989 a conflict occurred in the crew during the submarine 's preparation for patrol duty .
63 63-202 203 1.0 false And thus the requirements of the `` Manual of Submarine Damage Control '' -LRB- RBZh-PL-82 -RRB- were violated .
63 63-203 204 1.0 false RBZh-PL-82 , Article 173 : `` Departure for sea is prohibited ... when
63 63-204 205 1.0 false Due to objective causes the submarine crew could not have possessed high professional skill and experience in operating the material , which ultimately affected the outcome of the crew 's fight for the submarine 's survival .
63 63-205 206 1.0 false How are submarine crews trained in training centers ?
63 63-206 207 1.0 false The navy also lacks a system of occupational selection of submarine crewmembers on the basis of psychological stability in extreme situations .
63 63-207 208 1.0 false Does he really feel that a combat patrol by a submarine under fully self-contained conditions is any less complex and dangerous a mission than a flight into space ?
63 63-208 209 1.0 false Submarine crews are perpetually diverted from combat training for garrison duty , for housekeeping work and for other incidental duties , and this occurs both during construction and testing of a submarine and during patrol duty .
63 63-209 210 1.0 false And because submarines are provided an unsatisfactory supply of electric power and working power production units , it is impossible to organize high quality crew training aboard the submarine itself .
63 63-210 211 1.0 false The entire burden of this work is laid upon the submarine crews .
63 63-211 212 1.0 false But in reality submarine crews are physically unable to carry out the full volume of routine maintenance and inspection with acceptable quality within the 40 days allowed to them .
63 63-212 213 1.0 false The submarine fleet has even evolved a system of `` failure to failure '' equipment operation .
63 63-213 214 1.0 false Moreover the difficulties of routine maintenance and inspection aboard this submarine were aggravated by the absence of a set of documents concerning refits between cruises .
63 63-214 215 1.0 false This proposal was shamelessly distorted in the 8 August 1989 edition of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA , in which the need for company service was explained by the low quality of submarine construction .
63 63-215 216 1.0 false There are full grounds for suggesting that the submarine set out on its cruise with a faulty gas analyzer and a faulty television system .
63 63-216 217 1.0 false It follows from this reply that the submarine went to sea with a faulty system of batch blowing of ballast tanks .
63 63-217 218 1.0 false Review of video tape showing the location at which this camera is secured permits a categorical conclusion -- the television camera had been removed from the submarine at the base , prior to its cruise .
63 63-218 219 1.0 false RBZh-PL-82 , Article 173 : `` Departure for sea is prohibited ... in
63 63-219 220 1.0 false But to satisfy its own internal plans the command of the Northern Fleet tasked the submarine for ordinary patrol duty , which could have been carried out by any of dozens of other submarines in the fleet .
63 63-220 221 1.0 false mission posed for this patrol duty -LRB- That is , the submarine 's last cruise. -- D.R. -RRB- was to carry out scientific research together with hydrographic research vessels from 14 April to the end of May 1989 . ''
63 63-221 222 1.0 false Seven April 1989 rolled around .
63 63-222 223 1.0 false The submarine command is fighting this attitude toward duty , but without results as yet .
63 63-223 224 1.0 false So what are we told by the entries in the ship 's log for 7 April 1989 from midnight to the time when the command `` Deliver LOKh to compartment 7 ! '' resounded like a shot ?
63 63-224 225 1.0 false The lack of information regarding the submarine 's operation was already discussed .
63 63-225 226 1.0 false However , as a rule submarine crews do not make a practice of using this system in their day-to-day activities , and they do not use it at times of accidents .
63 63-226 227 1.0 false He reported to me that the submarine had been inspected , without remarks , somewhere around 1100 .
63 63-227 228 1.0 false This logical conclusion is reinforced by entries in the ship 's log and the testimony of surviving members of the submarine crew .
63 63-228 229 1.0 false But in the government commission 's report there is absolutely no mention of oxygen as one of the possible causes of the tragedy that occurred aboard the submarine .
63 63-229 230 1.0 false However , the oil separation system was disconnected early in the morning on 7 April , and it was not working before the accident .
63 63-230 231 1.0 false None of this was done aboard the submarine .
63 63-231 232 1.0 false Because of this , it was impossible to begin venting compartment 3 in time , and for a long time the control room personnel were forced to wear ShDA apparatus , which made submarine damage control difficult .
63 63-232 233 1.0 false From this moment on , the submarine would be left without electronic observation resources .
63 63-233 234 1.0 false The command was given to deenergize the `` Sinus '' -- the power supply system of the submarine 's automatic equipment control system .
63 63-234 235 1.0 false We do n't know if other fire extinguishers were used as well , but one thing is clear -- it can not be said that the quality of the submarine crew 's preparation for the cruise was high .
63 63-235 236 1.0 false Lining plates began separating away from the right side of the submarine 's outer hull , in the vicinity of main ballast tank No. 10 , which was noted by Captain Lieutenant Verezgov .
63 63-236 237 1.0 false Still , the submarine command did apparently receive the report of a deflagration in compartment 5 . Was information on the fire in compartment 5 reflected in the actions of the submarine command ?
63 63-237 238 1.0 false These entries in the ship 's log are nothing other than a reaction by the submarine command to the report they received of a deflagration in compartment 5 .
63 63-238 239 1.0 false The submarine 's attitude was not monitored during the entire accident .
63 63-239 240 1.0 false The submarine command did not even try to determine the reason for the increasing list .
63 63-240 241 1.0 false Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev : `` When the submarine surfaced , it was listing to port .
63 63-241 242 1.0 false First of all , a list of even 8ë is not dangerous from the standpoint of maintaining the submarine 's transverse equilibrium , and sacrificing buoyancy reserve on it is highly unsuitable .
63 63-242 243 1.0 false Second , before the submarine 's list was corrected , the reason for it should have been clarified , which was not done .
63 63-243 244 1.0 false This would have made it possible not only to correct the list but also to trim the submarine .
63 63-244 245 1.0 false The main danger to a submarine is the loss not of transverse but of longitudinal equilibrium .
63 63-245 246 1.0 false Such that on the whole , the decision of the submarine command to flood the right main ballast tank No. 5 was incompetent .
63 63-246 247 1.0 false Prior to the accident the submarine was at a depth of 386 meters .
63 63-247 248 1.0 false During emergency surfacing , in all probability `` Molibden '' console operator Lieutenant Zaytsev did not connect the tank to the high-pressure air blowing line , and the submarine surfaced with main ballast tank No. 5 unblown .
63 63-248 249 1.0 false The submarine command designated new lines of defense .
63 63-249 250 1.0 false In this particular situation of inactivity , forcing reduction of pressure in compartments 6 and 7 would have led to the earlier demise of the submarine .
63 63-250 251 1.0 false After fulfilling the command of the attack center to close the high-pressure air subgroup valves , the submarine was left without air , and for practical purposes without damage control resources .
63 63-251 252 1.0 false Obviously this was the sole person in the crew who knew the submarine well .
63 63-252 253 1.0 false It would not be long before the submarine would find itself without electric power , and consequently without communication with the outside world .
63 63-253 254 1.0 false Practically the entire reserve of high-pressure air -- the principal means of damage control and of maintaining the submarine 's stability -- was gone .
63 63-254 255 1.0 false Had it been transmitted at this time , the tender `` Aleksey Khlobystov '' could have reached the site of the accident before the submarine 's demise , and most of the crew would have been saved .
63 63-255 256 1.0 false But the submarine 's leadership apparently did not have enough courage to adopt an untraditional decision , and radio the distress signal in uncoded text .
63 63-256 257 1.0 false For such initiative , the submarine command would have received harsh treatment , despite the fact that there 's no official prohibition on transmitting an SOS .
63 63-257 258 1.0 false The submarine had a single free exit up through the hatch of the rescue chamber .
63 63-258 259 1.0 false Apparently the submarine 's leadership itself came to understand the absurdity of this undertaking .
63 63-259 260 1.0 false Captain Lieutenant Speranskiy used a hydroelectric manipulator to close the bulkhead clack valves , and Warrant Officer Kozhanov began preparing the ShDA apparatus and deenergized electrical equipment not affecting the submarine 's power and control. ''
63 63-260 261 1.0 false Warrant Officer V. F. Slyusarenko -LRB- explanatory report -RRB- : `` The submarine commander gave orders to measure the CO concentration in the compartment .
63 63-261 262 1.0 false What was the estimate of the accident situation during this period by the submarine 's leadership ?
63 63-262 263 1.0 false Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada -LRB- interrogation tape recording -RRB- : `` According to the BCh-5 commander 's calculations , in the worst-case scenario -- flooding of the aft compartments -- the submarine would lose stability by 1500 .
63 63-263 264 1.0 false Nothing was known about how things stood with evacuation of people , but at this time the submarine commander gave orders to evacuate secret business documents , which was documented in the ship 's log .
63 63-264 265 1.0 false Later on Captain 1st Rank Kolyada talked long and often about the submarine 's demise being a surprise to the crew , which is why the personnel were unable to make full use of rescue resources .
63 63-265 266 1.0 false And as we can see , all of the entries in the ship 's log regarding VVD-200 confirm in writing the submarine personnel 's poor knowledge of its material .
63 63-266 267 1.0 false Lieutenant A. V. Zaytsev -LRB- interrogation tape recording -RRB- : '' Then we turned on the diesel engine and exhaust fans -- air began flowing into the submarine . ''
63 63-267 268 1.0 false Accelerated cooling of the submarine 's nuclear reactor by way of the battery-less cooling system -LRB- the BBR system -RRB- was proceeding with forced circulation of water in loop 1 by the loop 1 circulating pumps -LRB- TsNPK -RRB- .
63 63-268 269 1.0 false The automatic system and equipment of the reactor compartment activated the emergency shielding , managed the reactor 's steady cooling and monitored all of its parameters until the submarine went down .
63 63-269 270 1.0 false There are full grounds for believing that the submarine command was unable to man large damage control parties .
63 63-270 271 1.0 false What was happening at this time in the submarine ?
63 63-271 272 1.0 false Luckily it was impossible to carry it out -- otherwise the submarine may have sunk an hour earlier , and no one would have been saved .
63 63-272 273 1.0 false Nor were any attempts made to find out what was happening in the aft part of the submarine , and what sort of change was occurring in draft and trim .
63 63-273 274 1.0 false RBZh-PL-82 , Article 42 : `` In case of accident the submarine senior watch officer is obligated : ... to
63 63-274 275 1.0 false directly lead the personnel 's damage control efforts on the upper deck and in the superstructure when the submarine is on the surface. ''
63 63-275 276 1.0 false The submarine had a zero trim by the stern as of 1300 .
63 63-276 277 1.0 false Here is how the fourth and seventh sections of the government commission 's working group evaluated change in the submarine 's draft and trim over time , on the basis of an analysis of photographs taken from an airplane
63 63-277 278 1.0 false At 1239 an IL-38 airplane was dispatched to the accident location , for some reason without a submarine specialist aboard .
63 63-278 279 1.0 false It was also communicated that an airplane was en route to the submarine with an estimated time of arrival of 1400 .
63 63-279 280 1.0 false Unfortunately the headquarters of the Northern Fleet did not furnish documents to the government commission 's working group regarding communication exchanges between the distressed submarine and the fleet command post .
63 63-280 281 1.0 false It may be concluded from the radio messages that the submarine command concealed the true scale of the accident from the headquarters of the Northern Fleet from the very beginning .
63 63-281 282 1.0 false How could there be any talk of submerging the submarine in a disaster of such a scale ?
63 63-282 283 1.0 false The list to port was a constant concern to the submarine command .
63 63-283 284 1.0 false Two and a half hours had gone by after the submarine surfaced .
63 63-284 285 1.0 false During this time the attack center could have ascertained that a list of 6-8 degrees is not dangerous to a submarine , and that it would make no sense to waste time and resources correcting it .
63 63-285 286 1.0 false Contrary to this , the submarine command stubbornly tried to correct the list , and in doing so , it used the most irrational method .
63 63-286 287 1.0 false Sending the damage control party to compartment 6 meant that in the opinion of the submarine command the fire had gone out in it , and pressure in the distressed compartments had fallen to a value close to 0 .
63 63-287 288 1.0 false And it is difficult to say what other misfortunes would have come upon the submarine and its crew .
63 63-288 289 1.0 false The airplane arrived in the accident region and established communication with the submarine , and the first photographs were taken .
63 63-289 290 1.0 false It was communicated from the airplane that surface ships would reach the submarine by 1800 .
63 63-290 291 1.0 false At this time a query was transmitted to the submarine from Northern Fleet headquarters by way of the airplane regarding entry of water into the pressure hull and regarding the fire .
63 63-291 292 1.0 false In the meantime the submarine began tipping to starboard as the starboard main ballast tank No. 10 filled .
63 63-292 293 1.0 false The submarine 's leadership had no basis for asserting that the fire was still burning in the distressed compartments .
63 63-293 294 1.0 false The assertion of the submarine command that water was not entering the pressure hull was also groundless .
63 63-294 295 1.0 false Listing of the submarine had shifted to starboard .
63 63-295 296 1.0 false On the whole these messages did not reflect the actual state of the distressed submarine , and disoriented the Northern Fleet 's command post .
63 63-296 297 1.0 false 1538 -- Message received : A submarine is 100 km away , moving toward us at 14 knots .
63 63-297 298 1.0 false A Soviet submarine was traveling toward the accident location .
63 63-298 299 1.0 false It is unclear how the freon canisters were to be transferred from the airplane to the submarine .
63 63-299 300 1.0 false The standard submarine supply table lacks special instruments with which to check bulkhead temperature .
63 63-300 301 1.0 false It was clear that submarine damage control efforts were gradually shutting down .
63 63-301 302 1.0 false Much was written in the press about `` explosions , '' after which the submarine quickly sank .
63 63-302 303 1.0 false Thus , Vice Admiral V. V. Zaytsev stated : `` Explosions were heard aboard the submarine in the aft compartments at 1624 .
63 63-303 304 1.0 false The submarine acquired a trim by the stern , which attested to entry of water into the pressure hull and a danger of flooding. '' -LSB- . sup -RSB- 45 -LSB- / -RSB-
63 63-304 305 1.0 false A clear cause-and-effect relationship is drawn here between the `` explosions '' on one hand and abrupt worsening of the situation and the submarine 's demise on the other .
63 63-305 306 1.0 false Captain 1st Rank B. G. Kolyada -LRB- interrogation tape recording -RRB- : `` Explosions began at the stern , explosions that shook the submarine .
63 63-306 307 1.0 false The submarine was jarred , but not strongly enough to rupture the pressure hull. ''
63 63-307 308 1.0 false This was an hour before the submarine sank .
63 63-308 309 1.0 false And more likely the `` explosions '' that were `` heard '' by Captain 1st Rank Kolyada in the conning tower superstructure and by Vice Admiral Zaytsev in Moscow have no relationship to actual events aboard the distressed submarine .
63 63-309 310 1.0 false Several words should be said about the jarring of the submarine observed during the time of the accident .
63 63-310 311 1.0 false They began 30 minutes after surfacing , and they went on throughout the entire time the submarine was on the surface. ''
63 63-311 312 1.0 false What was the crew 's assessment of the status of the distressed submarine at 1624 , when information concerning `` explosions '' was entered into the ship 's log ?
63 63-312 313 1.0 false `` Yes , we were all truly certain until the last minutes that we would be able to save the submarine .
63 63-313 314 1.0 false The submarine 's trim did not change until 1620 , and there were no signs of water entering the pressure hull. ''
63 63-314 315 1.0 false The report was received from the submarine at 1635 : `` The fire is intensifying .
63 63-315 316 1.0 false The loss of buoyancy reserve and the decrease in longitudinal stability of the submarine may have been determined by measuring its draft , and with a few simple computations .
63 63-316 317 1.0 false In sending the message cited here , as early as before 1635 the submarine leadership already believed that the ship was destined to sink .
63 63-317 318 1.0 false How do we explain such an abrupt change in the nature of messages from the distressed submarine ?
63 63-318 319 1.0 false How suitable was this decision , and how did it affect the stability and unsinkability of the submarine ?
63 63-319 320 1.0 false Main ballast tanks No. 5 and 7 are situated forward of the submarine 's center of gravity .
63 63-320 321 1.0 false When they are blown , in addition to an increase in buoyancy reserve the submarine 's trim by the stern increases .
63 63-321 322 1.0 false When two main ballast tanks on one side were blown simultaneously , the submarine was shaken severely , and it tilted abruptly toward the stern .
63 63-322 323 1.0 false This abrupt change in the submarine 's attitude was the cause of change in the nature of accident reports .
63 63-323 324 1.0 false Senior Lieutenant of Medical Service L. A. Zayats -LRB- explanatory report -RRB- : `` Somewhere around 1630-1340 I went up out of the submarine for the last time .
63 63-324 325 1.0 false It would be pertinent to recall here the previously cited assertion by Captain 1st Rank Kolyada that the submarine 's trim did not change before 1620 .
63 63-325 326 1.0 false Messages received from the submarine at 1635 and 1641 were like a bolt out of the blue to the naval command .
63 63-326 327 1.0 false It says evacuate the entire submarine crew .
63 63-327 328 1.0 false Thus when it sent the message that the Northern Fleet 's command post received at 1635 , the submarine 's leadership already believed that the ship was doomed .
63 63-328 329 1.0 false It is one thing to evacuate to approaching vessels , and another thing into the waters of the Norwegian Sea .
63 63-329 330 1.0 false '' How were the submarine personnel prepared for evacuation .
63 63-330 331 1.0 false Such was the explanation given by the captain 1st rank to the wide masses of laborers to his egress topside from the submarine .
63 63-331 332 1.0 false Thus the crew of the submarine was preparing for evacuation to approaching vessels , although its leadership already knew at this time that they would have to evacuate into the water , into the Norwegian Sea .
63 63-332 333 1.0 false Use of the high-pressure air reserve in the commander 's tank group for damage control would have radically altered the situation aboard the submarine even in the last stage of the accident .
63 63-333 334 1.0 false Given all of the conditions , this would have kept the submarine afloat until the arrival of the tender `` Aleksey Khlobystov '' .
63 63-334 335 1.0 false These bits of paper turned out to be more precious to the submarine 's leadership than the lives of the people .
63 63-335 336 1.0 false Lieutenant A. L. Stepanov -LRB- explanatory report -RRB- : `` Everyone in the submarine was preparing for evacuation to a vessel .
63 63-336 337 1.0 false The submarine commander gave orders to prepare secret documents for evacuation .
63 63-337 338 1.0 false We left the secrets in the submarine and raced topside. ''
63 63-338 339 1.0 false Lieutenant Zaytsev 's assertion that it was dark at this moment in the submarine is inconsistent with reality , and is not confirmed by a single participant of the tragedy .
63 63-339 340 1.0 false Can any navy staffer guarantee that the contents of this box , as well as of the other boxes and bags , are lying at the bottom of the Norwegian Sea , and not being studied in other countries ?
63 63-340 341 1.0 false Fulfilling the incompetent order to close shut-off 1 of the exhaust ventilation system , Warrant Officer Kadantsev simultaneously opened the exhaust ventilation shaft flooding valve -- that is , he unwittingly promoted faster flooding of the submarine .
63 63-341 342 1.0 false The rescue vessels were still far away , while the cold waters of the Norwegian Sea were right there .
63 63-342 343 1.0 false Because of the poor administrative skills of the submarine 's leadership , most of the crew was without them .
63 63-343 344 1.0 false Immediately after the submarine surfaced , the personnel began preparing the PSN- 20 rescue rafts for launching .
63 63-344 345 1.0 false Submarine Senior Watch Officer Captain Lieutenant A. G. Verezgov -LRB- interrogation tape recording -RRB- : `` All I had were two log books for the rafts and some brief written instructions .
63 63-345 346 1.0 false I never did realize that the submarine was sinking , and so I continued pulling at the raft .
63 63-346 347 1.0 false Suddenly the water went over my head as the submarine rose to vertical and the impact of the water .
63 63-347 348 1.0 false As the submarine sank further , the positive buoyancy of the raft caused the line by which it was secured to the railing on the conning tower superstructure to break , and it rose to the surface .
63 63-348 349 1.0 false `` Armchair-seamen '' journalists began a campaign bemoaning and deriding Russian equipment and seeking its mythical inadequacies on the basis of statements by such `` experts '' in the press , but more about that later .
63 63-349 350 1.0 false It was precisely at this time that the last message was received from the submarine : `` Trim increasing abruptly .
63 63-350 351 1.0 false The Rescue Chamber : Much was written in the press about why submarine commander Captain 1st Rank Ye .
63 63-351 352 1.0 false A. Vanin went back down into the submarine .
63 63-352 353 1.0 false In the opinion of the authors of such articles , while topside the commander learned that there were still people down below , and this motivated him to go back inside the submarine .
63 63-353 354 1.0 false So why did the commander , who was topside , go back inside the submarine ?
63 63-354 355 1.0 false Apparently the submarine commander went topside in order to estimate the situation and to give the order to prepare the rescue chamber for separation from the ship , because at this time all the personnel were topside .
63 63-355 356 1.0 false I ran back for Ispenkov , and at that moment the submarine tilted severely to the stern .
63 63-356 357 1.0 false In addition Slyusarenko 's statement confirms that the lighting was functioning in the submarine 's compartments until the very last moment , and Lieutenant Zaytsev 's assertion of the reverse is inconsistent with reality .
63 63-357 358 1.0 false Under certain conditions the chamber could have become a very great aid in survival of people in the frigid waters of the Norwegian Sea .
63 63-358 359 1.0 false The rescue chamber is secured at its coaming by a rack-and-pinion release to the coaming of the submarine , such that a waterproof space -LRB- the fore chamber -RRB- is created between it and the ship 's hull .
63 63-359 360 1.0 false The submarine was already going down , but I managed to force the upper conning tower hatch down with my legs. ''
63 63-360 361 1.0 false Warrant Officer V. S. Kadantsev -LRB- the newspaper PODVODNIK ZAPOLYARYA , 20 April 1989 -RRB- : `` They were in the VSK .
63 63-361 362 1.0 false It was not until the submarine 's trim equalized that Captain 3d Rank Yudin and Warrant Officer Chernikov were able to drag Warrant Officer Slyusarenko into the chamber .
63 63-362 363 1.0 false Before the hatch was closed we heard noise recalling boiling water -- obviously air was escaping from the sinking submarine . ''
63 63-363 364 1.0 false As we can see from this , air entered the chamber from the submarine at the moment the lower hatch of the rescue chamber was being battened down , creating an elevated pressure within it .
63 63-364 365 1.0 false In addition the rescue chamber was `` tethered '' by this hose to the submarine 's pressure hull .
63 63-365 366 1.0 false The sequence of the personnel 's actions following separation of the rescue chamber from the submarine was presented somewhat differently in Warrant Officer Slyusarenko 's explanatory report .
63 63-366 367 1.0 false We can not be fully certain that the personnel had carried out all of the operation to separate the rescue chamber from the submarine correctly , even with the help of the posted instructions .
63 63-367 368 1.0 false With the lower conning tower hatch open , the crew could not have done anything to separate the rescue chamber from the submarine until pressure within the submarine equalized with the outside water pressure .
63 63-368 369 1.0 false The nature of the damage and the positions of the damaged structures clearly indicate that this damage occurred after the submarine struck bottom .
63 63-369 370 1.0 false When the submarine struck bottom , the pressure tanks in compartments 2 and 3 ruptured , producing a hydraulic shock .
63 63-370 371 1.0 false It damaged the upper cover of the entry hatch of compartment 1 , and helped the rescue chamber to separate from the submarine .
63 63-371 372 1.0 false In 1975 , during strength trials on an experimental compartment of this submarine , the testing chamber was ruptured by a hydraulic shock .
63 63-372 373 1.0 false The conditions causing it were repeated in relation to many parameters during the submarine tragedy .
63 63-373 374 1.0 false The attempts by Slyusarenko and Chernikov to place the mask of the breathing apparatus over the submarine commander 's head were unsuccessful .
63 63-374 375 1.0 false We were all without life jackets , no one had expected the submarine to disappear so quickly. ''
63 63-375 376 1.0 false And in the newspaper PODVODNIK ZAPOLYARYA -LRB- 20 April 1989 -RRB- the participants of the event shared their memories : Captain Lieutenant V. A. Gregulev : `` And some did n't know how to swim .
63 63-376 377 1.0 false All of the subsequent actions by warrant officers Slyusarenko and Chernikov to put the IDA-59 masks over the faces of Yudin and submarine commander Vanin occurred while the rescue chamber was on the surface .
63 63-377 378 1.0 false On an image of the visible part of the rack-and-pinion ring securing the rescue chamber to the submarine hull , one section of this ring may be classified as a section with a broken tooth .
63 63-378 379 1.0 false The absence of imagery of the matching part of the release on the submarine 's pressure hull does not permit any definite conclusion .
63 63-379 380 1.0 false This question could be clarified fully only by raising the rescue chamber or submarine .
63 63-380 381 1.0 false In August - September 1991 a deep-sea submersible inspected the matching part of the rack-and-pinion release on the submarine 's pressure hull .
63 63-381 382 1.0 false It sank together with the commander of the submarine , Captain 1st Rank Ye .
63 63-382 383 1.0 false A. Vanin , Captain 3d Rank V. A. Yudin and Warrant Officer A. V. Krasnobayev , and it is now lying on the bottom of the Norwegian Sea with the upper hatch open , in ideal conditions for raising .
63 63-383 384 1.0 false Analysis of the crew 's actions during the accident revealed its total inability to fight for the submarine 's survival .
63 63-384 385 1.0 false The submarine sank with 25 percent of its reserve of high-pressure air unused , with the diesel generator operating , with an operating electric power system , with working damage control equipment , and with functioning electric lighting .
63 63-385 386 1.0 false The absence of the RBITS negatively affected both the crew 's training in submarine damage control problems and its actions during the accident .
63 63-386 387 1.0 false No real or imaginary imperfections in equipment , systems and the submarine itself were the cause of the accident and the fire in compartment 7 , or influenced the tragedy 's outcome .
63 63-387 388 1.0 false And that this submarine had supposedly been classified as `` nominally '' in the first line -- that is , on the fighting team , with the `` grace '' of the navy .
63 63-388 389 1.0 false This was a fighting submarine , and it was designed , built and transferred to the navy on the basis of standards and requirements imposed on a fighting submarine .
63 63-389 390 1.0 false Unfortunately this has not ended the discussion of the experimental submarine .
63 63-390 391 1.0 false Moreover , for what sort of other operation can an experimental submarine be transferred besides experimental ?
63 63-391 392 1.0 false And in order to be persuaded of this , it would be sufficient to compare experimental models of Russian articles at exhibitions with the series-manufactured models of these same articles sold in stores .
63 63-392 393 1.0 false Professionals know that their presence in a submarine directly influences its survivability. ''
63 63-393 394 1.0 false The vice admiral 's logic is astounding : If it is a unique submarine , then it must have unique design deficiencies .
63 63-394 395 1.0 false reads : `` In the fight to save the submarine , the crew displayed self-sacrifice and courage , but in the situation as it was , the submarine could not be saved. ''
63 63-395 396 1.0 false It was not until after his departure in summer 1987 that the attitude toward this crew , its training and time at sea changed abruptly for the better. ''
63 63-396 397 1.0 false Vice Admiral Chernov commanded the submarine flotilla until June 1986 , and not until summer 1987 , as Kalashnikov asserts .
63 63-397 398 1.0 false This would have been fully enough time to form and train a new crew for any submarine .
63 63-398 399 1.0 false In both publications Gorbachev blames the demise of the submariners and the submarine itself on the designer on the basis of rumors and talks with `` yardkeeper acquaintances '' of his .
63 63-399 400 1.0 false The fire was predestined by the poor preparation of the ship for the cruise and the grossest violations of the rules of operating the submarine 's equipment .
63 63-400 401 1.0 false Nor was the compartment fully involved aboard the submarine in the initial period of the accident .
63 63-401 402 1.0 false The former commander of the submarine asked some questions that sound very strange coming from him -- `` Who taught the submariners to use the life rafts and prepare them for use ?
63 63-402 403 1.0 false What other word can you use to describe the attempt to blame the designer for the submarine 's demise without any proof or justifications ?
63 63-403 404 1.0 false Nor could you have known that the American submarine `` Thrasher '' sank not due to `` inadequate underwater unsinkability '' but for an entirely different reason .
63 63-404 405 1.0 false None of this information is contained in the adventure novels on the basis of which you probably developed your ideas about submarine building .
63 63-405 406 1.0 false And do n't recall Admiral S. O. Makarov and Academician A. N. Krylov in vain , believe me that submarine designers also understand unsinkability and the procedure for designing particular systems and entire submarines .
63 63-406 407 1.0 false Something has to be said about the articles written by the writer N. A. Cherkashin , a former submarine deputy commander for political affairs .
63 63-407 408 1.0 false It was unique , because the nuclear- powered submarine was itself unique : a special hull , navigation at very great depth ... . '' -LSB- . sup -RSB- 56 -LSB- / -RSB-
63 63-408 409 1.0 false It seems that a fire depends on the structure and material of the hull , as well as on the depth at which a submarine travels .
63 63-409 410 1.0 false Five years of accident-free operation confirmed the high operating reliability of the submarine , and this time was fully sufficient to reveal any deficiencies , if there were any .
63 63-410 411 1.0 false A. Zelenskiy , Captain 2d Rank V. V. Stafanovskiy and many other submariners are not builders of submarines , but this does n't keep them from making a realistic assessment of the level of occupational training of submarine crews .
63 63-411 412 1.0 false Allow me to inform you , my respected writer , that the sorry specialists from the 1st Submarine Flotilla misled you .
63 63-412 413 1.0 false It would be pertinent here to cite the following statement by division deputy commander Captain 1st Rank Kolyada , as presented by the writer N. A. Cherkashin : `` The submarine behaved normally .
63 63-413 414 1.0 false When compartments 6 and 7 are flooded at the same time that main ballast tank No. 10 is flooded , the submarine loses 50 percent of its buoyancy reserve at the stern .
63 63-414 415 1.0 false This is not counting the unblown tank No. 5 and the flooded starboard tank No 7 . Elementary logic tells us that no submarine can remain afloat with such loss of buoyancy and with such an upsetting moment .
63 63-415 416 1.0 false It was because of this professional incompetency that the crew found itself in the frigid waters of the Norwegian Sea without rescue equipment , and was forced to pay for this with its life .
63 63-416 417 1.0 false The newspaper SMENA -LRB- 15 April 1990 -RRB- carried an article by Captain 1st Rank -LRB- Retired -RRB- V. A. Boyko titled `` No Culprits as Usual ? ''
63 63-417 418 1.0 false He is in a better position to know how imperfect the concepts of and requirements on submarine design are in relation to survivability .
63 63-418 419 1.0 false cites specific `` deficiencies '' of the submarine which , in the opinion of the authors influenced the tragedy 's outcome .
63 63-419 420 1.0 false Such a system does not exist in the navy 's requirements on submarine design .
63 63-420 421 1.0 false The leadership of submarine formations is responsible for such development .
63 63-421 422 1.0 false There is no need to bring up the fact that not a single submarine of the navy has an integrated system for forecasting possible development of events in extreme situations on the basis of objective data .
63 63-422 423 1.0 false No submarines of the navy have a system for controlling the airtightness of compartments from the control room -LRB- with the exception of a certain class of submarine with a limited number of personnel -RRB- .
63 63-423 424 1.0 false Development of such systems for manned compartments is not foreseen in the navy 's requirements on submarine design .
63 63-424 425 1.0 false Introduction of such a system into a submarine would be equivalent to complicating the design , increasing the weight and size characteristics of the equipment , and reducing its reliability .
63 63-425 426 1.0 false As for the degree to which these negative indicators could be compensated by the anticipated increase in submarine survivability , the answer to this question can be provided only through meticulous design development .
63 63-426 427 1.0 false None of the `` design peculiarities '' could have caused the accident and the demise of the submarine .
63 63-427 428 1.0 false Nor is optimism raised by the nonspecific nature of measures to create training centers and establish submarine basing and technical maintenance conditions .
63 63-428 429 1.0 false 2 . For practical purposes there was only one tank containing turbine oil in compartment 7 of the submarine , and not three -- a 9 m -LSB- . sup -RSB- 3 -LSB- / -RSB-
63 63-429 430 1.0 false Five years of the submarine 's operation demonstrated the effectiveness of the system for removing oil vapor from the air of compartments .
63 63-430 431 1.0 false The complaints of the authors of the remark that the designers failed to satisfy the requirements of the TPPL-75 -LSB- Submarine Design Requirements -RSB- are wrong .
63 63-431 432 1.0 false Thus these TPPL- 75 were not introduced on any submarine of the navy .
63 63-432 433 1.0 false Because such cable was difficult to manufacture , it was not used aboard any submarine .
63 63-433 434 1.0 false Recommendations of the design office regarding the use of the submarine 's equipment in emergency situations , 21.GGK-E-478-82 , do not foresee closure of valves on oil pipelines when sealing compartment 7 .
63 63-434 435 1.0 false The attempt to criticize the `` Recommendations '' 21.GGK-E-478-82 drawn up by the designer is wrong , because they were not intended for use by submarine personnel .
63 63-435 436 1.0 false 4 . The complaint of the authors of the remark that the absence of instructions on testing the airtightness of the submarine 's intercompartment bulkheads with a 100 mm Hg vacuum is unjustified .
63 63-436 437 1.0 false Other resources capable of extinguishing a fire at elevated pressure are not foreseen by the submarine 's design .
63 63-437 438 1.0 false The submarine lacks resources for extinguishing a fire at compartment pressures exceeding 2 kg /cm -LSB- . sup -RSB- 2 -LSB- / -RSB- . ''
63 63-438 439 1.0 false It does not make any sense to introduce this information into LOKh system operations , because the instructions are not part of the set of submarine damage control documents .
63 63-439 440 1.0 false The assertions of the authors of the remark that a fire extinguishing concentration of freon could not be created in compartments 6 and 7 because of the absence of freon reserves aboard the submarine are unfounded .
63 63-440 441 1.0 false The consequences : This resulted in a fire in the GKP , which complicated leadership of submarine damage control efforts. ''
63 63-441 442 1.0 false Compartment 3 filled with gas , and so the attack center was compelled to carry out the subsequent submarine damage control actions while wearing individual protective equipment .
63 63-442 443 1.0 false Introduction of switching apparatus into control circuits unjustifiably complicates the circuits and reduces the reliability of a submarine 's electric power system as a whole .
63 63-443 444 1.0 false Even after the circuit breaker tripped in the distribution panel RShchN- 12 , located in compartment 7 , the electric power system of the submarine remained serviceable , and continued to function until the end of the tragedy .
63 63-444 445 1.0 false `` The kingstonless design of the TsGB sharply reduces the longitudinal stability of a submarine when it is not in trim and when the sea is disturbed .
63 63-445 446 1.0 false The consequences : This resulted in the flooding of TsGB No. 8 , 9 , 10 and disturbance of their integrity , as a result of which the submarine lost buoyancy and longitudinal stability. ''
63 63-446 447 1.0 false In addition sea state begins to affect the buoyancy reserve of a submarine -LRB- and not its longitudinal stability , as the authors of the remark assert -RRB- at a sea state of 5 - 6 points or more .
63 63-447 448 1.0 false The submarine surfaced with its starboard main ballast tanks No. 5 and 10 not blown .
63 63-448 449 1.0 false The submarine sank as a result of flooding of compartment 7 and partially of compartment 6 , with absolutely no damage control efforts attempted by the personnel .
63 63-449 450 1.0 false In addition to this , the submarine lacks instruments by which to monitor the submarine 's static attitude in a disturbed sea -LRB- violation of the requirements of articles 9.2.5 ,
63 63-450 451 1.0 false The means of objectively monitoring change in the submarine 's attitude are lacking , making it impossible for the GKP to correctly predict the submarine 's behavior when water enters a compartment and the TsGB . ''
63 63-451 452 1.0 false `` The design does not foresee a system for monitoring the filling -LRB- blowing -RRB- of the submarine 's TsGB .
63 63-452 453 1.0 false Not a single submarine of the navy has a system for monitoring the filling of main ballast tanks .
63 63-453 454 1.0 false The consequences : RAVA hoses ruptured in response to fire and the elevated temperature in the compartment , which led to uncontrolled flooding of the compartment and loss of the submarine 's longitudinal stability and buoyancy. ''
63 63-454 455 1.0 false The submarine lacks a program supporting the reliability of technical resources -LRB- the requirements of Article 2.3 of the OTT6 .1.1 - 81
63 63-455 456 1.0 false A log was developed and a spare set of equipment not used aboard other classes of submarines was delivered in order to keep the submarine 's reliability high .
63 63-456 457 1.0 false During the accident these circuit breakers provided for automatic disconnection of damaged networks , distribution panels and damaged electrical equipment , and ensured trouble-free operation of the electric power system until the submarine 's demise .
63 63-457 458 1.0 false `` The number of personnel calculated by the central design office serving as the designer was insufficient to service equipment in normal conditions , and absolutely not enough to carry out submarine damage control in times of accident .
63 63-458 459 1.0 false Without the consent of industry the navy increased the crew to 57 persons by its Directive No. 730/2/00395 dated 23 April 1982 ; in this case the number of personnel in BCh-5 was increased by only one person .
63 63-459 460 1.0 false Apparently the navy felt that this number was fully sufficient for this department , which maintains technical resources and carries out submarine damage control .
63 63-460 461 1.0 false Were the qualifications of the specialists adequate , the increase that was made in the crew size to 64 persons would have been quite enough to maintain the submarine under normal operating conditions .
63 63-461 462 1.0 false The requirement of Article 173 of the RBZh-PL-82 , which prohibits a submarine from going to sea undermanned , was violated .
63 63-462 463 1.0 false The consequences : Absence of communication made efficient leadership of submarine damage control practically impossible. ''
63 63-463 464 1.0 false This assertion by the authors of the remark is only an excuse for the inactivity of the submarine 's command in damage control efforts .
63 63-464 465 1.0 false 2 . Article 12.2.9 of the TPPL-75 discusses relief of pressure by compressors in normal submarine operating conditions , which has nothing in common with the remarks here , and therefore the reference to it is incorrect .

65 65-45 46 1.0 false The Japanese are working on similar technology but opted in the early 1970s for an electrodynamic levitation system - where magnets repel rather than attract each other .
65 65-46 47 1.0 false The different system also creates a 10cm gap , rather than 10mm , between the vehicle and the runway which the Japanese say is better suited to deal with earthquake risks .
65 65-47 48 1.0 false The Transrapid technology creates magnetic fields of about 40 amps - no bigger than those created by an electric razor - while the Japanese have to grapple with big magnetic fields of up to 700,000 amps .

65 65-65 66 1.0 false The success in Hamburg was also decisive for the construction of the pilot system unique in the world for railway systems , the Emsland Transrapid Pilot System -LRB- TVE -RRB- .
65 65-66 67 1.0 false The Transrapid high-speed maglev railway has proven its everyday usefulness in continuous service with a running capacity of more than 160,000 km and a world-record speed of 450 km/h .
65 65-67 68 1.0 false Also a prerequisite for this is the plan -- which is no less innovative -- adopted by the federal government for the financing and private-sector operation of the Berlin - Hamburg high-speed maglev railway .
65 65-68 69 1.0 false For example , the operating company that will operate the high-speed maglev railway will be privately financed for the first time .
65 65-69 70 1.0 false Furthermore , the financing proposal also provides for a high degree of taking the burden off the federal government in financing of the railway .
65 65-70 71 1.0 false It will prove strikingly the creativity and forcefulness of engineers , who with the high-speed maglev railway have also continued a part of the tradition showing them to be pioneers of progress .
65 65-71 72 1.0 false Although over 25 years have passed since development began on superconducting magnetic levitation -LRB- maglev -RRB- rail systems , the steady stream of research results is at the verge of blossoming .
65 65-72 73 1.0 false Before development began at the Railway Technical Research Institute , the MLU002 test vehicle was completed in March 1987 and began trial runs on the Miyazaki test track .
65 65-73 74 1.0 false However , quench , the state where superconductivity is not maintained , occurred frequently in the superconducting magnet , the most important element in superconducting magnetic levitation .
65 65-74 75 1.0 false -LRB- 2 -RRB- To achieve improved reliability of the superconducting magnets and low magnetic field leakage into the cars , the pole pitch of the superconducting magnets is shortened .
65 65-75 76 1.0 false -LRB- 3 -RRB- In order to increase energy savings , the method used is sidewall levitation where the levitation coils are shaped like the number eight and have small magnetic repulsive force -LRB- magnetic resistive force -RRB- .
65 65-76 77 1.0 false A large levitation force is obtained by using sidewall levitation .
65 65-77 78 1.0 false As explained earlier , the most important issue in implementing a maglev railway is improving the stability and reliability of the superconducting magnets .
65 65-78 79 1.0 false In particular , the mechanical strength of the epoxy resin that is the mold material for the sidewall levitation coils was carefully checked .
65 65-79 80 1.0 false Similar to airplanes , cars in maglev railway travel are not in contact with anything when traveling in the high-speed region , therefore , the quality of the noise differs from that of railroads .
65 65-80 81 1.0 false Experts have pointed out that the reason for the large power consumption in the running tests at the Miyazaki test track is a maglev railway is a transportation method with poor energy efficiency .
65 65-81 82 1.0 false Since the ground facilities for a maglev railway use many drivers and controllers in the primary ground method , the cars can be much slimmer than conventional cars .
65 65-82 83 1.0 false There is the impression that a maglev railway generates strong magnetic fields that harm the human body .
65 65-83 84 1.0 false In fact , the effect of the magnetic fields generated by the superconducting magnets on the passengers and on people who live along the track is at the same level as the magnetic fields they normally live in .
65 65-84 85 1.0 false Many electrical appliances like electric razors , hair dryers , televisions , and washing machines that everyone uses have magnetic fields .
65 65-85 86 1.0 false The magnetic fields of medical treatment pads -LRB- 1,300 gauss -RRB- for stiff shoulders or magnetic necklaces are also close to the body .
65 65-86 87 1.0 false Furthermore , the whole body is exposed to a maximum of 20,000 gauss -LRB- stationary magnetic field -RRB- in magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- equipment that is rapidly spreading in the medical field to image tomograms .
65 65-87 88 1.0 false Of course , artificial precision devices such as heart pacemakers in the body and video cameras are sensitive to magnetic fields .
65 65-88 89 1.0 false The development of the maglev railway is entering the stage where efforts will center on improving reliability and reducing costs in the move towards practical use .
65 65-89 90 1.0 false The results may lead to a deeper understanding of most of the technical issues and the final evaluation of the maglev railway may become possible .
65 65-90 91 1.0 false The ME concept is a program for using magnetic force to levitate and run a train above rails laid on land and in the ocean .
65 65-91 92 1.0 false With the votes of the coalition , the Bundestag has passed a planning law for the magnetic levitation vehicle link .
65 65-92 93 1.0 false It was necessary to pass this law to begin construction of the already agreed upon `` Transrapid `` magnetic levitation vehicle link between Hamburg and Berlin .
65 65-93 94 1.0 false The construction of the first stretch of the magnetic levitation link is essential primarily to secure export chances of the technology involved .
65 65-94 95 1.0 false On the other hand , the SPD criticized not just the magnetic link itself , but the planning methods used .
65 65-95 96 1.0 false Military personnel and railway workers also have frequent recourse to the telephone .
65 65-96 97 1.0 false In addition to the power companies -LRB- EVU -RRB- and the former Federal Railway System , the armed forces are also exempted from DBP Telekom 's telephone service monopoly .
65 65-97 98 1.0 false The know-how gained by the Stuttgart workers in developing these systems is now becoming an export hit .
65 65-98 99 1.0 false But from now on , the main concentration will be on people 's living standards , ' says theJapan Development Bank .
65 65-99 100 1.0 false Private consortiums also are developing large commercial and residential ventures in the area .
65 65-100 101 1.0 false HSST Corporation of Nagoya is separately promoting three schemes , including an inter-city maglev railway that would cruise at 186mph , a commuter version and a downtown people -mover .
65 65-101 102 1.0 false Instead of conventional engines , the Transrapid is propelled by magnetic fields .
65 65-102 103 1.0 false It has no wheels and rather than run on conventional railway tracks it clutches a concrete runway rather like the runner on a curtain rail .
65 65-103 104 1.0 false The technology dates from the 1920s when Hermann Kemper , an electronic engineer who ran a meat packing business near the present 32km test site in Emsland , began poring over papers about the theory of magnetic levitation .
65 65-104 105 1.0 false Conventional magnetic levitation works by using the repellant force of superconductive magnets of opposite polarities .
65 65-105 106 1.0 false In the Transrapid , propulsion comes from the force of magnetic attraction .
65 65-106 107 1.0 false By passing electrical current through a stator pack , the stationary part of an electric motor which is laid out on the underside of a concrete runway , a wandering magnetic field is created .
65 65-107 108 1.0 false This magnetic field - called wandering because it moves down the runway - is attracted or excited by levitation magnets mounted on the underside of the Transrapid , so propelling the vehicle forward .
65 65-108 109 1.0 false Because the Transrapid glides above a concrete runway it does not need to overcome the resistance between track and wheels which traditional railway technology still has to grapple with .
65 65-109 110 1.0 false Magnetic-levitation systems use a magnetic field to propel trains forward and to elevate them one to four inches above an elevated guideway .
66 66-0 1 1.0 true Among them was Christa McAuliffe , the first private citizen to fly in space .
66 66-1 2 1.0 false Karen Allen heads the cast as schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe .
66 66-2 3 1.0 false Karen Allen , best known for her starring role in `` Raiders of the Lost Ark , '' plays McAuliffe .
66 66-3 4 1.0 false But Allen was eventually won over because of McAuliffe , the high school teacher and mother from Concord , New Hampshire .
66 66-4 5 1.0 false In preparation , Allen spent hours watching and re-watching videos of McAuliffe .
66 66-5 6 1.0 false By studying the tapes , Allen said , she was able to capture McAuliffe 's `` rhythm '' -- how she walked , talked , stood and even how she held her head .
66 66-6 7 1.0 false By the time Allen arrived at NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston last summer to shoot `` Challenger , '' the actress felt a kinship to McAuliffe .
66 66-7 8 1.0 false At NASA , Allen worked alongside the same people who knew and worked with McAuliffe .
66 66-8 9 1.0 false Allen went through a lot of the same training McAuliffe did , including a pilot training course so she could obtain a special license to fly in the KC-135-the plane that simulates weightlessness .
67 67-0 1 1.0 false It takes just one blow of a steamboat whistle on the quay at New Orleans to find yourself transported into the storybook past of the Mississippi paddleboats .
67 67-1 2 1.0 false In Life on the Mississippi , Mark Twain wrote that it was every boy 's ambition to be a steamboat man .
67 67-2 3 1.0 false Some people prefer the Mississippi Queen with such modern amenities as cinema and pool .
67 67-3 4 1.0 false The scenery on the 682-mile round trip from New Orleans to Vicksburg , on the lower Mississippi , is disappointing .
67 67-4 5 1.0 false TS Eliot called the Mississippi 'a great brown god ' , and it captivates quickly .
67 67-5 6 1.0 false During the civil war it was a Confederate stronghold defending the whole of the lower Mississippi .
67 67-6 7 1.0 false These , as long as five football fields , tend to take up the whole river as they round bends .
67 67-7 8 1.0 false There is so much traffic that the Delta Queen 's jovial Captain John Davitt compares the river to 'driving on an interstate highway ' .
67 67-8 9 1.0 false Avoiding these obstacles , and the barges , requires great skill from the river pilots who drive the steamboats .
68 68-0 1 1.0 true This helps explain why Peruvian fishermen dubbed the phenomenon El Nino , which means Christ child in Spanish .
68 68-1 2 1.0 true It was named El Nino , Spanish for boy child , by fishermen off Peru who noticed an increase in water temperature followed by torrential rain .
68 68-2 3 1.0 false Grain traders are keen to know if they can expect this year 's El Nino to disturb the US weather pattern sufficiently to make a dent in crop output .
68 68-3 4 1.0 false Although signs of El Nino had been accumulating during 1991 , only last month did the the US National Weather Service finally conclude publicly that the phenomenon was a fact .
68 68-4 5 1.0 false While many of these conditions indicate that El Nino is occurring , they do not reveal its severity .
68 68-5 6 1.0 false Mr Vernon Kousky , a research meteorologist with the US weather service , now assesses the current El Nino as 'moderate to strong ' .
68 68-6 7 1.0 false While individual weather events can not always be directly attributed to El Nino , some signals are indicative of its strength .
68 68-7 8 1.0 false Mr Kousky says that El Nino , usually a 12 to 18 month event , has another six to 12 months to run .
68 68-8 9 1.0 false But he points out that there is no consistent relationship between El Nino and the weather pattern beyond the winter-to-spring months .
68 68-9 10 1.0 false These additional factors along with El Nino probably mean that a more extreme weather pattern bleeds over into summer , according to Mr Kevin Marcus , director of Crop Cast services .
68 68-10 11 1.0 false He is still waiting for more data on the severity of this year 's El Nino .
68 68-11 12 1.0 false In 1972-73 the El Nino destroyed the Peruvian fishmeal catch , which then accounted for some 45 per cent of the world trade in protein feed .
68 68-12 13 1.0 false El Nino , a weather phenomenon first detected by Peruvian fishermen at the turn of the century , could leave much of rural Australia praying for rain next year , weather forecasters said Friday .
68 68-13 14 1.0 false El Nino may bring drought conditions to eastern Australia , where farmers are suffering from falling commodity prices and high interest rates , they said .
69 69-0 1 1.0 true This helps explain why Peruvian fishermen dubbed the phenomenon El Nino , which means Christ child in Spanish .
69 69-1 2 1.0 true El Nino , a weather phenomenon first detected by Peruvian fishermen at the turn of the century , could leave much of rural Australia praying for rain next year , weather forecasters said Friday .
69 69-2 3 1.0 true It was named El Nino , Spanish for boy child , by fishermen off Peru who noticed an increase in water temperature followed by torrential rain .

69 69-5 6 1.0 false While many of these conditions indicate that El Nino is occurring , they do not reveal its severity .
69 69-6 7 1.0 false Mr Vernon Kousky , a research meteorologist with the US weather service , now assesses the current El Nino as 'moderate to strong ' .
69 69-7 8 1.0 false While individual weather events can not always be directly attributed to El Nino , some signals are indicative of its strength .

7 7-4 5 1.0 false For the year ended July 31 , Qintex Australia paid the management company $ 32.6 million -LRB- Australian -RRB- .
7 7-5 6 1.0 false Qintex 's resort business also has been hammered since Australian pilots began a strike in late August that reduced tourism revenue by as much as 32 % in September from a year earlier , one analyst said .
7 7-6 7 1.0 false `` One of the good things about Qintex is it certainly has top-quality assets . ''
7 7-7 8 1.0 false And -- until Skase bid for MGM/UA -- the Qintex chairman appeared to be a more frugal buyer of Australian assets , according to Shvets .
7 7-8 9 1.0 false The letter was never delivered , however , and on Oct. 10 the deal collapsed amid rancorous accusations and a MGM/UA lawsuit accusing the Australian Qintex firm of fraud .
7 7-9 10 1.0 false But analysts pointed out that Qintex had apparently counted on MGM/UA 's cash -- estimated at $ 145 million -- to help address Qintex 's short-term cash flow problems .
7 7-10 11 1.0 false Some analysts were still reeling from the Qintex Entertainment bankruptcy filing last week , because they believed the U.S. company had the Australian 's group full backing .
7 7-11 12 1.0 false When a $ 5.9-million payment to MCA Inc. came due , however , Qintex Entertainment sought the court 's protection because -- even with the help of Qintex Australia -- financing could not be arranged , the company said .
7 7-12 13 1.0 false One of Qintex 's most visible assets remains the Dana Point resort project in Orange County , which an official described as a top priority now that the MGM/UA deal has collapsed .
7 7-13 14 1.0 false `` This is very important to the company , '' said a Qintex official .
7 7-14 15 1.0 false Qintex bought two sites in the beach town for about $ 247 million this summer and plans to build a resort for affluent guests .
7 7-15 16 1.0 false Qintex Australia Ltd. , the media and property empire built by entrepreneur Christopher Skase , went into receivership Tuesday in an effort to ward off complete liquidation .
7 7-16 17 1.0 false The court appointed David Crawford and John Allpass , chartered accountants with KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords , as receivers and managers of Qintex Australia and 28 associated companies , stripping Skase of an operational role in the company .
7 7-17 18 1.0 false Peter Buchanan , a lawyer representing Qintex , told the Supreme Court in Victoria state that it is vital for Seven Network and other Qintex television stations to continue operating so they do not lose their broadcasting licenses .
7 7-18 19 1.0 false Crawford and Allpass were given wide powers , including the right to hire and fire , sell Qintex assets and borrow money .
7 7-19 20 1.0 false Qintex Entertainment has been in Chapter 11 since the parent company refused to advance needed cash after the aborted MGM/UA deal .
7 7-20 21 1.0 false The banks wanted to avoid a liquidation , he said , because the sale of all Qintex assets would cover only a bit more than half the outstanding debts .
7 7-21 22 1.0 false Qintex purchased the 232-acre parcel near Dana Point in southern Orange County last July and took an option on a 115-acre property nearby with the intention of building a luxury resort .
7 7-22 23 1.0 false Local real estate experts said the price Qintex paid for the larger property -- $ 132 million -- was exorbitant .
7 7-23 24 1.0 false Qintex owns two luxury resorts in Australia and the Princeville resort in Hawaii .
7 7-24 25 1.0 false The court appointed chartered accountants David Crawford and John Allpass from KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords as receivers and managers of Qintex Australia and 28 associated companies , stripping Skase of an operational role in the company .
7 7-25 26 1.0 false But Qintex earlier this month forfeited its right to the Headlands property when it missed an installment payment , and it now appears that the Monarch Beach property will be put on the block .

70 70-7 8 1.0 false All but eight of the aircraft 's 271 passengers and crew , mostly Japanese and Taiwanese , were killed in the crash of the Airbus A300- 600R , arriving in Nagoya from Taipei .
70 70-8 9 1.0 false It was the fifth China Airlines crash since 1986 and the 11th since 1969 , giving the airline a significantly higher ratio of crashes per flight hours than the world average .
70 70-9 10 1.0 false Meanwhile , compensation for the crash is turning out to be a thorny issue for CAL .
70 70-10 11 1.0 false Sun submitted his resignation in the wake of the April 26 China Airlines ' Airbus crash at Nagoya , Japan .
70 70-11 12 1.0 false A China Airlines aircraft bound from Taipei in Taiwan to Nagoya in western Japan crashed and exploded yesterday in Japan 's second worst airline disaster .
70 70-12 13 1.0 false Taiwan 's China Airlines -LRB- CAL -RRB- , under pressure about safety after its worst crash , has banned its pilots from playing mahjong while abroad after they were criticised for living decadent lives , say airline officials .
71 71-0 1 1.0 false But there is one valid parallel -- DiMaggio , like Antley , did n't just coast along in 1941 .
71 71-1 2 1.0 false One day , though , someone ran a different notion by Dom : A book about 1941 .
71 71-2 3 1.0 false If ever the major leagues had a magical , almost mythic year , it was 1941 .

73 73-28 29 1.0 false Part of Pal 's thesis is that nobody thought the building was such a big deal until the British moved into India .
73 73-29 30 1.0 false But no big-name European artist was ever magnetized to India in the way Morocco attracted Delacroix or the South Seas seduced Gauguin .

82 82-130 131 1.0 false Amazingly , Ripken , who turns 29 next Thursday , recovered and it was n't until 1987 that his streak of consecutive innings was halted , as much to stem the publicity as anything else .

85 85-46 47 1.0 false Duke left the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1980 , accused by another leader of selling secret membership rolls .
85 85-47 48 1.0 false The final days of the race brought renewed charges that Duke still was associated with right-wing extremists , including ex- American Nazi leader Ralph Forbes of Arkansas .

85 85-55 56 1.0 false I always figured that David Duke would make something of himself .
85 85-56 57 1.0 false That 's because Republican leaders are worried that Duke , who has recently been running something called the National Assn .
85 85-57 58 1.0 false But while Duke insists on calling himself a Republican , the GOP is stuck with the former klansman .
85 85-58 59 1.0 false Despite his loony-sounding affiliations , Duke is not your typical political-fringe dingbat .
85 85-59 60 1.0 false I found that out in 1977 , when Duke first got widespread public attention outside of Louisiana .
85 85-60 61 1.0 false I was covering Mexican border issues for The Times , and ran across Duke when the 27-year-old racist hit on the idea of a Klan `` border watch . ''

85 85-66 67 1.0 false But as I ponder his recent success , I think there 's a way that Latinos can use Duke to their advantage this time .
85 85-67 68 1.0 false Duke 's victory is the logical extreme of Nixon 's cynical politics .
85 85-68 69 1.0 false But maybe with an embarrassment like Duke now sitting on their right flank , Republicans like Atwater will be more inclined to act on their good impulses as well as talk about them .
85 85-69 70 1.0 false Duke is somebody else 's problem now , but his reemergence has created an opportunity for minorities in the Republican Party .
85 85-70 71 1.0 false They must exploit what Duke symbolizes -- the same way he has eagerly exploited what minorities symbolize to many misguided people .
85 85-71 72 1.0 false `` I think the racists in this city are people like Jesse Jackson , '' Duke said at a Chicago news conference after addressing the national convention of the right-wing Populist Party of America .
85 85-72 73 1.0 false Jackson declined comment on Duke 's statements , except to say : `` I do n't think it 's an American point of view . ''

85 85-77 78 1.0 false Some dismiss Duke 's election by just 200 votes as an anomaly ; his suburban New Orleans district is 99 % white .
85 85-78 79 1.0 false But Suall and other trackers of racial tension believe that disparate events , such as Duke 's slim victory at the polls and the rise of the racist skinhead subculture , are warning signs to be taken seriously .
85 85-79 80 1.0 false At a shopping mall on the edge of Duke 's district , a white woman in her 30s offered her opinion but would not give her name :
85 85-80 81 1.0 false `` Or , '' he said , `` these people can vote for a David Duke in the belief they can protect what is mine . ''
85 85-81 82 1.0 false Duke , however , believes that he is only the first to tap a growing sentiment .
85 85-82 83 1.0 false Duke Sees a Trend
85 85-83 84 1.0 false Duke was elected after several unsuccessful attempts .
85 85-84 85 1.0 false The differences between then and now , says Duke , are the sophistication of his organization and a change in the mood of the voters .

85 85-88 89 1.0 false Duke vowed to fight to have his measure tacked onto another bill as an amendment .
85 85-89 90 1.0 false Duke , however , is unlike his demagogic predecessors .
85 85-90 91 1.0 false But his message is the same old line in `` new '' Duke code .
85 85-91 92 1.0 false In discounting Duke 's chances , pundits like to cite a Johnston poll that put Duke 's negative rating at 48 % , a number that would scare most politicians into retirement .
85 85-92 93 1.0 false One reason is that Duke 's is a campaign in perpetuity .
85 85-93 94 1.0 false But sensing Duke 's blue-collar support , state GOP leaders rejected Rickey 's motions , thereby handing the former Klansman a mantle of legitimacy .
85 85-94 95 1.0 false The Faustian pact backfired when two ex- Nazis and a former Klan activist showed up as Duke delegates to the convention that nominated Bagert , who was a Democrat until 1988 .

85 85-102 103 1.0 false To fill the Duke -fact gap , the coalition has become an informational clearinghouse , with Rickey and Hill briefing media across the state .
85 85-103 104 1.0 false Still , too many journalists do not question such Duke statements as : `` I was never involved in any illegal activity , and I do n't condone illegal activity . ''
85 85-104 105 1.0 false In truth , Duke was convicted , in 1979 , of inciting a riot outside a hotel in the district he now represents .

85 85-112 113 1.0 false The State Department has no record of Duke 's employment .
85 85-113 114 1.0 false Like Jimmy Swaggart , another folk hero sprung from these latitudes , Duke is a walking psychodrama , challenging reporters to separate fact from the many fictions of his speech .
85 85-114 115 1.0 false Yet surely many voted for Duke to send a message , not to embrace the messenger .
85 85-115 116 1.0 false Whites cast ballots for Duke ; blacks stayed home , with turnout 15 % less than whites , despite the threat that Duke posed .

85 85-127 128 1.0 false The Louisiana GOP plans to endorse a candidate Jan. 12 , but Duke said that he probably will run even if he is not the party 's choice .
85 85-128 129 1.0 false Duke , who in the past has been associated with the far-right Populist Party , disavowed his racist beliefs when he was sworn in as a state representative .

85 85-133 134 1.0 false In 1988 , he ran for the presidency as a member of the Populist Party .
85 85-134 135 1.0 false The seat opened up when Metairie 's representative was elected to a judgeship with about three years left in a four-year term .
85 85-135 136 1.0 false Spokesman for Klan
85 85-136 137 1.0 false But he had to overcome a Republican opponent endorsed by some GOP heavyweights -- including President Bush and former President Reagan -- to do it .
85 85-137 138 1.0 false So he announced that Klan members would begin patrolling the border to help the U.S. Border Patrol catch illegal aliens .
85 85-138 139 1.0 false He and seven other men showed up in three old sedans that had hand-painted `` Klan Border Watch `` signs taped on their doors .

90 90-107 108 1.0 false The Scientology movement has launched a concerted campaign to gain a foothold in the nation 's schools by distributing to children millions of copies of a booklet Hubbard wrote on basic moral values .
90 90-108 109 1.0 false The program is designed to win recognition for Hubbard as an educator and moralist and , at the same time , introduce him to the nation 's youth .
90 90-109 110 1.0 false The pocket-size booklet , entitled `` The Way to Happiness , '' is a compilation of widely agreed upon values that Hubbard put into writing in 1981 .

90 90-159 160 1.0 false In describing the Org Board 's virtues , Scientology consultants omit Hubbard 's colorful account of its origins -- an account reminiscent of one of his science fiction tales .
90 90-160 161 1.0 false During a 1965 lecture to Scientologists in England , Hubbard said his board is a refined version of one that was used for `` 80 trillion years `` by an `` old galactic civilization . ''
90 90-161 162 1.0 false Hubbard said the civilization died -LRB- he did not say when -RRB- because its organizational board lacked one division that he incorporated into his modern-day version .

90 90-166 167 1.0 false As far back as 1959 , Hubbard warned that illness and even death can befall those seeking to impede Scientology , known within the church as `` suppressive persons . ''

90 90-179 180 1.0 false What Hubbard actually meant , according to the spokesmen , was that Scientology will not protect ex- members from people in the outside world who try to trick , sue or destroy them .

99 99-7 8 1.0 false Shapiro takes us through the detective story of how genetics developed , and lucidly explains the nature of the genome and the task of investigating it .
99 99-8 9 1.0 false Both books make admirable and successful efforts to equip general readers with a clear grasp of the issues - an important matter , because the future of genome research prompts a number of difficult questions .
99 99-9 10 1.0 false This is illustrated by both books when they turn from explanation of the genome project to the consequences of its successful completion .
99 99-10 11 1.0 false This surprising discovery , by Mike Gale , Graham Moore and colleagues at Britain 's John Innes Centre in Norwich , working with the Japanese Rice Genome Research Programme , has huge implications for cereal breeding .
99 99-11 12 1.0 false Rice will become the main focus of genetic research in cereals , because its genome is so much smaller and therefore easier to manipulate than the other species .
99 99-12 13 1.0 false The government-funded Rice Genome Research Programme , is now half way through the task of discovering the precise chemical sequence of the estimated 30,000 rice genes .
99 99-13 14 1.0 false The sum of all genetic material in a given organism is called the 'genome ' .
99 99-14 15 1.0 false When finally interpreted , the genetic messages encoded within our DNA will provide the ultimate answers to the chemical underpinnings of human existence . '
99 99-15 16 1.0 false Armed with so much genetic knowledge , will we be tempted to manipulate the genetic material of future people not just to exclude hereditary diseases , but to make them taller , more intelligent , more athletic ?
99 99-16 17 1.0 false Should employers know the genetic profile of potential employees , some of whom they might refuse to employ because they have , say , a genetic risk of early death from heart disease ?
