 SemEval 2015 Baseline for Task 3: Answer Selection in Community Question Answering

 INSTALLATION
 
This project is based on UIMA and the DKPro Similarity framework.
It uses Maven for managing dependencies. So make sure you have Maven
installed in your system.

For Ubuntu you can type:

> sudo apt-get install maven

For official information check:
http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

I will describe two procedures for running the system: from Eclipse or from command line.

1) Running the system with Eclipse

Install Eclipse from: http://www.eclipse.org
Install the Maven plugin for Eclipse: http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/download/
Then, import the project selecting Import -> Existing Maven Project
Let Maven download all the dependencies during the first execution of:
qa.qcri.qf.semeval.baseline/src/main/java/qa/qcri/qf/semeval/baseline/Baseline.java

2) Running the system from command line

Open the terminal and go to the directory where you have deflated the archive.

In this directory there is a file named pom.xml

Run:

> mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package

to download and copy all the dependency JARs to the target/dependencies folder,
and to build the project JAR in the target folder.

Then, in order to run the baseline system type:

> java -cp target/dependency/*:target/qa.qcri.qf.semeval.baseline-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar qa.qcri.qf.semeval.baseline.Baseline


-----------------

	Following these steps will produce the train and development CSV files in the
	data/SemEval2015-Task3-English-data/dataset folder.

MODEL TRAINING AND EVALUATION

The script for training the model and producing the predictions is
written in Python and it is located in the main directory of the system
distribution. It is called subtask_ab.py.

The Python libraries required by the script are:
 - Pandas
 - Scikit-Learn
 
For installing Pandas follow the instructions here:
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html
 
For installing Scikit-Learn follow the instructions here:
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

To train and evaluate the model just run the eval.sh script.

> eval.sh

It will run the Python script and the scorer, in order to produce the
result reports for subtask A and subtask B.

If you get the following error:

Question IDs differ: gold='2725' predicted='2726' at SemEval2015-task3-scorer-subtaskB.pl line 88, <PREDICTED> line 12.
 
please remove line 12 from file data/SemEval2015-Task3-English-data/datasets/CQA-QL-devel-gold-yn.txt

 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE BASELINE SYSTEM

The class:

qa.qcri.qf.semeval.baseline/src/main/java/qa/qcri/qf/semeval/baseline/Baseline.java

produces two CSV files from the XML training and development data file.
These CSV files contain the comment identifiers, the gold labels, and the features
computed by the program. Such features are syntactical and are provided by
the DKPro Similarity module. They encode several kind of similarities between
the lemmas from a question and a comment. Stopwords loaded from a stoplist are
filtered out and they do not contribute to the similarity score.
